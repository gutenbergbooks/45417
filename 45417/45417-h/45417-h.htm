<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch01' class='c006'><i>Chapter I</i><br /> <br />OUT OF LUCK</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Above the speeding airplane, lowering
black of approaching night and storm; below,
the forest, grim and silent, swelling
over ridges, dipping into valleys, crestless
waves on a dark green ocean.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We can’t make it, Betty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy Dixon, at the controls, spoke
into the mouthpiece of her headphone set.</p>

<p class='c008'>Betty Mayo, in the rear cockpit, glanced
overside and shuddered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you can’t land on those trees!” she
cried shrilly. “We’ll crash—you know
that!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe we will—and maybe we won’t!”
returned Dorothy, gritting her teeth.
“Keep your eyes peeled for a pond or a
woodlot—anywhere you think we can
land.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What—what’s the matter?” called back
her friend, steadying her wobbly nerves
with an effort.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Matter enough. We’re nearly out of
gas—running on reserve fuel now. When
the rain starts, it’ll be pitch dark in no
time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Dorothy—do try to stay up! We
can’t crash and be killed—that’s what it
will mean if you try to land here!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Betty, be-have, will you? This is my
funeral.” The pilot in her anxiety, had
struck upon an unhappy choice of words.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, you must do something—this is terrible—”
the frenzied girl in the rear cockpit
almost shrieked.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy ripped off her headphone set.
She could no longer allow her attention to
be distracted by Betty’s excited whimpering.</p>

<p class='c008'>The small amphibian, flying low, topped
a crag-scarred ridge. At the foot of the
cliff she saw a tiny woodland meadow.</p>

<p class='c008'>Action in the air must be automatic.
There is never time to reason. With the
speed of legerdemain the young pilot sent
her plane into a steep right bank and
pushed down hard on the left rudder pedal.
The result was a sideslip, the only maneuver
by which the amphibian could possibly
be piloted into the woodlot. Tilted
sideways at an angle that brought a scream
from terrified Betty, the heavy mass of
wood and metal dropped like a plummet
toward the earth.</p>

<p class='c008'>This was too much for little Miss Mayo.
Convinced that her friend had lost control
of the plane, she closed her eyes and
prayed.</p>

<p class='c008'>With uncanny accuracy, considering
the rainswept gloom, Dorothy recovered
just at the proper instant. Hard down rudder
brought the longitudinal axis of the
plane into coincidence with its actual flight
path again. At the same time she brought
the up aileron into play, thereby preventing
the bank from increasing. Then as
the amphibian shot into a normal glide, she
leveled the wings laterally by use of ailerons
and rudder.</p>

<p class='c008'>Their speed was still excessive, so for a
split second or two, Dorothy leveled off
and fishtailed the plane. That is, she
kicked the rudder alternately right and
left, thereby swinging the nose from side to
side, and did so without banking and without
dropping the nose to a steeper angle.</p>

<p class='c008'>Taking the greatest possible care that
her plane was in straight flight prior to the
moment of contact with the ground, she
gave it a brief burst of the engine, obviating
any possibility of squashing on with
excessive force. The airplane landed well
back on the tail, rolled forward over the
bumpy ground and came to a stop at the
very edge of the little meadow, nose on to
the line of trees and underbrush.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy switched off the ignition,
snapped out of her safety belt and turned
round.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hail, hail, the gang’s all here,” she said
cheerfully. “Wake up, Betty! We’ve
come to the end of the line.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Betty opened her eyes and looked about
in startled amazement.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why—why we didn’t crash, after all!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Certainly not,” snorted Dorothy.
“D’you think I’d let <em>Wispy</em> mash up my
best friend? Come on, dry your eyes.
Good thing it’s so dark and none of the
boys are with us. You’d be a fine sight,”
she teased.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think <em>Will-o-the-Wisp</em> is a silly name
for a plane.” Betty’s remark was purposely
irrelevant. She wanted to change
the subject.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then don’t think about it. Turn your
mind upon the answer of that dear old
song, ‘Where do we go from here?’”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where are we?” Betty could be practical
enough when her nerves were not
tried too severely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mmm!” murmured her friend. “That’s
the question. I’m not quite sure, but I
think we’re on the New York State Reservation
over on Pound Ridge. A good ten
miles or more from home, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If we’re on the reservation we’re certainly
out of luck,” sighed Betty. “It’s a
terribly wild place—nothing but rocks and
ridges and woods and things. They keep
it that way on purpose.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nice for picnics on sunny days, I
guess,” affirmed Dorothy. “But not so
good on a rainy night, eh? Here, put on
this slicker before you’re wet through.
Then get down. We’ve got to move out of
here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Betty stood up, caught the coat Dorothy
threw into the cockpit, and after slipping
into it, she stared fearfully about.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are you waiting for?” Dorothy
inquired from below.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m going to stay where I am,” announced
Miss Mayo in a quavering voice.
“It’s safer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How safe?” Dorothy turned on her
flash light. Its moving beam brought into
bold relief the jungle of scrub oak and evergreens
that walled the little pasture.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Listen, Dorothy! I remember Father
saying that they preserved game on the
Pound Ridge reservation. There are sure
to be bears and—and other things in these
woods. Turn off the light—quick—they’ll
be attracted to us if we show a light—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bears—your grandmother!” said
Dorothy’s mocking voice and the light
flashed full on Betty. “Don’t be so silly.
Come down here at once!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I won’t. I’m going to stay up here.
I—I’m sure it’s safer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you can be ‘safer’ by yourself. If
you think I’m going to stick around this
woodlot all night, you’ve got another guess
coming. Snap out of it, won’t you, Betty?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you wouldn’t leave me all alone out
here!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Watch me.” The light began to move
away from the plane.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll come—I’ll come with you, Dorothy—wait!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The light came back and Betty scrambled
to the ground in a fever of haste.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, then, stop being a goop and take
this flash,” directed Dorothy. “Hold it on
the plane so I can see. We’ve got to make
<em>Wispy</em> secure, before we get under way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I s’pose you get that Navy lingo from
Bill Bolton.” Betty felt rather peevish
now. “You talk just like him ever since
he taught you to fly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wish he was here now,” retorted her
friend, and climbed into the cockpit.
“Here—take these wheel blocks and stop
grouching. And for goodness’ sake,
please don’t wobble that light! I want to
get these cockpit covers on before everything
is flooded.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A few minutes later she climbed down
again and after adjusting the wheel blocks,
took the flashlight from Betty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All set?” she inquired briskly. “Got
your knitting and everything? ’Cause it’s
time we were moving.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Betty began to cry.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think you’re mean—of course I want
to get out of here, but—but you n-needn’t—”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy put her arm about the smaller
girl’s shoulders.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There, there,” she comforted, “cheer
up. I won’t be cross any more. Here’s a
hanky, use it and come along. Gee, I wish
this rain would stop! It’s coming down in
bucketfuls.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m sorry, too, for sniveling,” said
Betty meekly. She made a strenuous effort
to be brave as they walked away from the
dark shape of the plane. “But don’t you
think you’d better get out your revolver,
Dorothy? Honestly, you know, we’re
likely to run into anything out here in these
woods.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy burst into a peal of laughter.
“Bless you, honey,” she chuckled. “I don’t
carry a gun when I go calling—or any
other time if I can help it. We’ll get out of
this all right, don’t worry. I should have
looked at the gas before we left home, but
I thought there was plenty to take us over
to Peekskill and back. <em>Wispy</em> eats the
stuff—that’s the answer!”</p>

<p class='c008'>They stumbled along on the outskirts of
the woodlot, Dorothy keeping her light
swinging from side to side before them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I thought you <em>always</em> carried a
gun—” insisted Betty, her mind still on the
same track—“you ought to, after all you
went through with those bank robbers and
then the gang of diamond smugglers!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, you’ve got to have a license to
tote a revolver—I’ll admit I’ve carried ’em
now and then—but not to a tea!” replied
her friend. “Do try and help me now, to
find a way out of this place.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But maybe there is no way out. We
can’t climb those cliffs, and this meadow’s
hemmed in by the woods. Oh, dear, I wish
I knew where we are!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m not certain,” mused Dorothy, more
to herself than to her companion, “but I
think I caught sight of the fire tower on the
ridge just before we sideslipped. That
would mean that this meadow is on the
eastern edge of the reservation—and that
there’s a road on the hill across from the
ridge. There must be a trail of some kind
leading in here. They could never get the
hay out or the cattle in, otherwise; this
place must be used for something.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They trudged along, keeping the trees
on their left until the farther end of the
meadow was reached. As they rounded
the corner the light from the flash brought
into view a narrow opening in the trees
and undergrowth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What did I tell you?” sang out
Dorothy. “There’s our trail! This certainly
is a lucky break!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where do you suppose it goes?”
Betty’s question was lacking in enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, it’s the tunnel from the Grand Central
to the new Waldorf-Astoria,” said
Dorothy, squinting in the darkness. “I’m
going to take a room with a bath. You can
have one, too, if you’re good!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Betty stumbled into a jagged wheel rut
and sat down suddenly. “Oh, my goodness!”
she moaned. “My new pumps are
ruined—and these nice new stockings are
a mass of runs from those nasty brambles!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Humph! Just think how lucky you
are to be alive,” suggested Dorothy callously.
“Look—we’re coming into another
meadow. Yes—and there’s a light—must
be a house up there on the hill.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What if they won’t let us in?” wailed
Betty.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were heading across the meadow,
now, toward the hill. Dorothy stopped
and turned the flashlight on her friend.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You certainly are a gloom!” she declared
angrily. “Do you think I’m enjoying
this? <em>My</em> shoes and stockings are
ruined, too, and this ducky dress I’m crazy
about has a rip in the skirt a yard long. It
will probably be worse by the time we get
through the brush on that hillside. But
there’s absolutely no use in whining about
it—and there’s not a darned thing to be
scared of. Is that clear to you, Betty?” She
paused, and then went on more gently.
“Come on, old thing, you’ll feel much better
when we’ve found a place to get warm
and dry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know you think I’m an awful baby.”
Betty tried her best to make her voice sound
cheerful, but her attempt was not a brilliant
success. “But I’m just not brave, that’s
all,” she went on, “and I do feel perfectly
terrible.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know. You’re not used to this kind
of an outing, and I am, more or less. But
I can see how it would upset you. Here’s
a stone fence. Give me your hand, I’ll help
you over. Fine! Now save your breath
for the hill. We’ve got a stiff climb ahead
of us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>For the next fifteen or twenty minutes
they fought their way up the steep slope
through a veritable jungle of thickets and
rock. In spite of frequent rests on the
boulders that dotted the hillside, both girls
were exhausted by the time they came to
another delapidated stone wall that acted as
a low barrier between the brush and an
over-grown apple orchard. Through the
gnarled trunks, they could dimly see the
shape of the house whence came the light.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy sat down on top of the wall,
and pulled Betty to a place beside her.
Then she switched off her flash.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Some drag, that!” Her breath came in
labored gasps.</p>

<p class='c008'>Betty was too weary to make any reply.
For a time they sat, silently. Then
Dorothy slid painfully off the wall into the
orchard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You stay here, Betty. I’m going over
to the house and reconnoiter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say! You don’t go without me!”
Betty sprang down with sudden determination.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then walk carefully and don’t make
any noise.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A tone of startled surprise came into
Betty’s voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What—what are you afraid of,
Dorothy?” she whispered excitedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not a thing, silly. But there may be
watch dogs—and I want to get some idea
of the people who live in that dump before
I ask ’em for hospitality. I’ve got myself
into trouble before this, going it blind. I
know it pays to be careful. If you must
come with me, you must, I suppose. But
walk behind me—and don’t say another
word.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She stalked off through the orchard with
Betty close at her heels.</p>

<p class='c008'>As they neared the house, which seemed
to be badly in need of repair, it was plain
that the light came from behind a shaded
window on the ground floor. Dorothy
stopped to ponder the situation. A shutter
hanging by one hinge banged dully in the
wind and a stream of rain water was shooting
down over the window from a choked
leader somewhere above. She felt a grip
on her arm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s don’t go in there,” whispered
Betty. “It’s a perfectly horrid place, I
think.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It doesn’t look specially cheerful,” admitted
Dorothy. “But there may not be
another house within a couple of miles.
There’s a porch around on the side. Maybe
we can see into the room from there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Together they moved cautiously
through the rank grass and weeds to the
edge of the low veranda. There was no
railing and the glow from two long French
windows gave evidence that the floor
boards were warped and rotting. The
howl of the wind and driving rain served
to cover the sound of their movements as
they tiptoed across the porch to the far window.
Both shades were drawn, but this
one lacked a few inches of reaching the
floor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Both girls lay flat on their stomachs and
peered in. Quick as a flash, Dorothy
clapped her hands over Betty’s mouth,
smothering her sudden shriek of terror.</p>

  <h2 id='ch02' class='c009'><i>Chapter II</i><br /> <br />TO THE RESCUE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The cold, wet wind of late September
howled around the house. Dorothy wished
she had brought a revolver.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stop it! Betty, stop!” she hissed and
forced her friend to crawl backward over
the rough boards to the edge of the porch.
“Stay here, and don’t make a sound. Do
you want them out after us? For goodness’
sake, take a grip on yourself! I’m
going back to the window and—not another
peep out of you while I’m gone!”
With this warning, she slithered away
before Betty could voice an objection.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lying flat before the window once more
with her face almost level with the floor,
she stared into the room. The scene had
not changed. Nor had the three principals
of the drama being enacted on the other
side of the pane moved from their positions.
A sudden gust tore loose the shutter
at the back of the house, sending it crashing
down on some other wooden object
with terrific racket.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Must have hit the cellar doors,” thought
Dorothy.</p>

<p class='c008'>The man with the cigar, who stood before
the cold fireplace stopped talking.
She saw him cock his head to one side and
listen. The bald-headed man in the leather
armchair kept his revolver levelled on the
room’s third occupant, and snapped out a
question. With a shrug, the man by the fireplace
went on speaking. He was a dapper
person, flashily dressed in a black and
white shepherd’s plaid suit which contrasted
disagreeably with the maroon overcoat
worn open for comfort. Dorothy
took a dislike to him at first sight. Not
withstanding his mincing gestures, the man
had the height and build of a heavyweight
prizefighter. Now he leaned forward,
emphasizing with a pudgy forefinger the
point of his oratory which was directed
toward the third member of the party.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy uttered an impatient exclamation.
She could not hear a word. The
roaring storm and the closed windows prevented
her from catching even the rumble
of their voices. She continued to gaze intently
upon the prisoner, a well set up youth
of eighteen or nineteen, curly-haired and
intelligent looking. Her sympathy went
out at once to this young fellow. He was
bound hand and foot to the chair in which
he sat. A blackened eye and his shirt,
hanging in ribbons from his shoulders,
told of a fight. Then she spied an overturned
table, books and writing materials
scattered over the rumpled rug.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whew!” she whistled softly. “He
staged a little battle for ’em, anyway, I’ll
bet!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She smiled as she noticed that the youth’s
opponents had likewise suffered. For the
bald-headed man held a bloodstained handkerchief
to his nose, while the other’s overcoat
was ripped from collar to hem and
he nursed a jaw that was evidently tender.</p>

<p class='c008'>The room which lay beneath her scrutiny
offered a decided contrast to the unkempt
exterior of the house. The walls
were completely lined with bookcases,
reaching from ceiling to floor. The shelves
must have held thousands of volumes. Essentially
a man’s library, the furnishings
were handsome, though they had evidently
seen better days.</p>

<p class='c008'>In reply to a question barked at him
from the dapper prize fighter, the young
prisoner shook his head in a determined
negative. The big man spat out an invective.
This time the boy smiled slightly,
shook his head again. With a roar of fury
that was audible to the watching girl outside,
the prize fighter-bully strode over to
his victim and struck him across the mouth.</p>

<p class='c008'>That brutal action decided Dorothy.
She wormed her way backward off the
porch. Betty was still crouched where she
had left her. She sprang up and caught
her friend’s arm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Isn’t it terrible?” she whispered tensely.
“He’s such a good-looking boy, too—don’t
tell me they’ve killed him or anything?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Without speaking, Dorothy led her
around to the back of the house.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, they haven’t killed him,” she answered
when they had reached the shelter
of the apple orchard. “This is no movie
thriller. But something pretty serious is
going on in there. Now tell me—are you
going to pull yourself together and be of
some help? Because if you’re not, you
can climb one of these trees and stay there
until it’s all over. That’s the only safe
place I know of—and even up there you’ll
get into trouble if you start screaming
again!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I really couldn’t help it, Dorothy.
He was such a darling looking boy
and—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My goodness—what have his looks got
to do with it? He’s in a peck of trouble—that’s
the principal thing. I want to help
him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, so do I!” asserted Betty eagerly.
“I’ll be good, honest I will.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Obey orders?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do my best.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“O.K. then. I’m going round front.
Those blackguards must have come in a
car—and I’m going to find it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you can’t leave me here alone—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There you go again, silly! I’m not
going to drive away in the car. I’ve got
another plan. Listen! There’s a cellar
door, somewhere back of the house I guess.
It’s one of the flat kind that you pull up
to open. I heard that shutter slam down
on it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose you want me to open it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bullseye!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You needn’t be so superior,” Betty’s
tone was aggrieved. “What’ll I do if it’s
locked?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, people ’way out in the country
never lock their cellar doors,” Dorothy’s
tone was impatient, her mind three jumps
ahead.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But suppose this one is?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wait there until I come back. Hurry
now—there’s no telling what’s going on
in that room. So long—I’ll be with you
in a few minutes. If you hear a crash,
<em>don’t scream</em>!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She raced away and as she reached the
corner of the side porch, a quick glance
over her shoulder told her that Betty was
marching resolutely toward the cellar
door.</p>

<p class='c008'>This time Dorothy skirted the porch
and toward the front of the house she came
upon a weed-grown drive which swept in
a quarter circle toward the road some fifty
yards away. A limousine was parked before
the entrance to the house. It was
empty.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy breathed a sigh of relief. She
hurried past the car and found that the
drive ran round the farther side of the
house, out to a small garage at the back.
The garage doors were open, and inside she
spied an ancient Ford. For some reason
the sight of the Ford seemed to perturb her.
She stood a while in deep thought.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then as an idea struck home, she drew
forth her flash light and sent its beam traveling
over the interior of the garage. She
did not take the precaution of closing the
doors. The library was on the other side
of the house and there was little danger of
her light being seen. Suddenly she uttered
a cry of satisfaction. Her light had
brought into view about a dozen gasoline
tins stacked in a corner. She lifted them
one by one—all were empty. She hunted
about and presently unearthed a short piece
of rubber hose from under the seat of the
automobile.</p>

<p class='c008'>“First break tonight!” she said to herself.
“Here’s hoping the luck lasts!”</p>

<p class='c008'>A few minutes later, if anyone had been
watching, they would have seen a girl in
a slicker, her dark curly hair topped by an
aviation helmet, leave the garage carrying
two gasoline tins. These she took to the
orchard and deposited them behind a
couple of apple trees.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her next movements were more puzzling.
She walked back to the garage and
around that little building to the side away
from the main house. Again her flash
light was brought into play. This time
she focussed it on the land to the side and
rear and saw that the low wall which partly
encompassed the orchard ended at the back
of the garage. There was no obstruction
between the drive at the side of the house
and a rough field that sloped sharply down
the valley whence she and Betty had come.
Then she realized that the house and orchard
lay on a plateau-like rise of land
which jutted out into the valley from the
main ridge, the ground dropping steeply
on three sides.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, the scenery couldn’t be sweeter!”
remarked Dorothy. “Now, I hope to
goodness they’ve left the keys.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was blowing half a gale now, and
rain in crystal rods drove obliquely
through the flash light’s gleam. She
switched off the light and stuffed it into a
pocket of her dripping slicker and beat
her way against the storm toward the
house. Here she found the limousine, and
hastened on toward the side porch.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lying flat at the window once more, she
saw that a fire had been started in the fireplace.
The dapper person crouched before
it, holding an iron poker between the
burning logs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy realized on the instant the
fiendish torture those beasts were planning.
She jumped to her feet and tiptoeing
over the boards, raced for the car.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her hand, fumbling on the dash,
brought a faint jangle from a bunch of
keys—</p>

<p class='c008'>“Break number three!” she cried and
slipped behind the steering wheel. As she
switched on the ignition she brought her
right foot down on the starter and when the
powerful engine purred she fed it more
gas and let in the clutch.</p>

<p class='c008'>The car rolled forward and she swung
it round the corner of the house toward the
garage, with her thumb pressed down hard
on the button of the horn.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’ll bring them out!” she chuckled
and slipping into high sent the car hurtling
off the drive, headed for the field beyond
the garage. An instant later she dropped
off the running board while the limousine
raced into the field and down the steep hillside
to the valley below—and destruction.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the same moment Dorothy heard
shouts from the house and footsteps pounding
on the gravel. She wasted no time
peering after the car. Turning on her
heel, she flew round the garage and over
to the rear of the house. The cellar door
was open, Betty was standing on the top
step.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Down you go!” panted Dorothy.
“Take this flash and switch on the light—quick!”</p>

<p class='c008'>A slight shove sent Betty stumbling
down the stone flight and Dorothy followed
more slowly, bringing down the
wide door over her head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The light, Betty, the light!” she cried.</p>

<p class='c008'>“B-but we can’t go into the house—those
men—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never mind the men—do as you’re
told. I can’t find the lock on this door
in the dark. Where are you, anyway?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Right here,” said a small voice and the
flash light gleamed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy shot home the bolt and took the
torch into her own hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Without waiting to see if her order was
obeyed, she ran to the stairs that led up to
the first floor. At the top of the short
flight, she found a closed door. She opened
it and stepped into the kitchen, with Betty
at her elbow. Locking the door behind
them, she flashed her light about the room,
then walked over to a table and pulled out
the drawer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here—take this!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Betty stepped back as a large kitchen
knife was thrust in her direction.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Take it!” commanded Dorothy and
again the smaller girl unwillingly did as
she was told.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But—but you can’t mean we’re going
to fight them with knives,” she spluttered,
“why, Dorothy—I just couldn’t—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t talk rot!” Dorothy’s tone was
caustic. “Please cut the argument, now—I
know what I’m doing!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Betty trotted at her heels as she crossed
the kitchen toward the front of the house,
passed through a swinging door into the
dining room. An arched doorway to their
right, brought the hall into view, and beyond
it, another door stood open, leading
into the lighted library, where they saw its
single occupant still tied to his chair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go in there and cut him loose,” directed
Dorothy.</p>

<p class='c008'>She pushed Betty into the room and
raced for the open front door. She heard
the sound of voices from the drive as she
neared the end of the hall. She could see
the figures of two men just beyond the
front steps. Just as her hand reached the
door handle, they turned in her direction
and the black night was seared with the
sharp red flash from an automatic.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch03' class='c009'><i>Chapter III</i><br /> <br />IN THE CONWAY HOUSE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>With the detonation of the gun in her
ears, Dorothy flung herself against the
door and slammed it shut. Her hand
fumbled for the key, found it and sent the
bolt shooting into place. About the house
the rain-lashed wind howled and moaned
like some wild thing in torment. Her
heart was pumping and her breath came
in choking gasps. Leaning against the
solid oak door she pressed her ear to a
panel.</p>

<p class='c008'>The noise of the storm muffled all other
sound, but she thought she could detect the
mumble of men’s voices just outside the
door. It was impossible to catch the words,
of course, but the mere sound told the girl
that they were standing on the small front
porch. To her right was a sitting room.
She hurried into it.</p>

<p class='c008'>A quick flash of her torch showed two
windows facing the drive. She tried the
catches. They were unlocked. She fastened
them and ran out of the room, down
the hall to the rear. The light from the
library threw the staircase into silhouette.
Dorothy started for the dining room, but
stopped short as the young man whom she
had sent Betty in to free, bounded into the
hall.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hello!” he cried. “Do you know where
they are?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy pointed toward the front door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Right out there!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good! I’ll fix ’em!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He raced up the stairs and she heard him
running toward the front of the house.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Betty!” she called. “Come here!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is it?” answered that young
lady’s voice from the library. “George
told me to stay in this room.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>George?</em>” exploded Dorothy. She ran
to the door and looked in. Betty was toasting
her soaking pumps from a chair before
the fire. She turned her head when Dorothy
appeared and beckoned toward the
blaze.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes—George Conway,” she explained
smilingly. “He owns this house, you see.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy’s fingers pressed the wall switch
and the electric lights went out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, you <em>are</em> a fast worker—” was her
comment. “Dash over to those windows
and see that they’re fastened. Then pile
some of these chairs and tables in front of
the French doors—anything will do, just
so it’s heavy. Hurry—and when you’ve
finished, go into the hall and stay there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Betty stared through the darkness. “But
George says—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t care <em>what</em> George says! The
hall is the safest place right now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, why can’t you help me?”
grumbled Betty. “Suppose those awful
men come before I’ve—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They won’t if you snap to it. I’m off
to fasten the windows in the rest of the
house.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This last was thrown over her shoulder
as she tore across to the dining room.
After making the rounds in there she went
into the kitchen. Here she found a window
open and the back door unlocked. It
took her but a moment to remedy this, and
she was passing back to the dining room
when there came a terrific crash and reverberation
from the floor above, followed by
screams and curses from outside.</p>

<p class='c008'>She went out into the hall and another
report from above shook the windows in
their frames.</p>

<p class='c008'>Betty, wild-eyed with fright, rushed into
the bright arc of Dorothy’s flash light.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What on earth is it?” she cried in very
evident alarm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shotgun,” said Dorothy tersely. “If
those yells meant anything, I guess we can
take it that somebody’s been hit.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then she noticed that Betty’s left hand
held an open compact, while in her right
she clutched a small rouge puff. Her ash-gold
hair which she wore long had become
unknotted and hung halfway down her
back. Her petite figure drooped with
weariness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gracious, Betty! How in the wide
world did you ever get rouge on the end
of your nose? You’re a sight!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, you turned out the light—” Miss
Mayo’s tone was indignant, as she rubbed
the end of her nose with a damp handkerchief.
“I think I’ll run upstairs and spruce
up a bit.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy looked at her and laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on up with me,” suggested Betty.
“You don’t look so hot yourself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, you run along and pander to your
vanity, my child. When you’ve finished,
why don’t you go into the kitchen and
make us a batch of fudge—that would be
just the thing!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why so sarcastic?” Betty raised her
delicate eyebrows.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well—what do you think we’ve run
into—a college houseparty or something?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I think you’re mean,” Betty pouted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you do choose the queerest times
to spiff up!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you think those men will try to get
in again!” Betty’s blue eyes widened.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If I didn’t know that your head was
a fluffball—But what’s the use. Run along
now. It sounds as if George were coming
down. Hurry up—you might meet him
on the stairs!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Cat!” said Betty and flew.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy went to the door and listened.
If the two men were still outside, they gave
no sign of their presence. Nothing came
to her ears through the panels but the howl
of the storm.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then she heard footsteps running down
the stairs from the second story and
switched her flashlight on George. He
carried a double barreled shotgun in the
hollow of his arm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Howdy!” he greeted her enthusiastically.
“You know, I can never thank you
girls enough for all you’ve done. Gosh!
You’re a couple of heroes, all right—I
mean heroines. When I saw Betty—I
mean, Miss Mayo,” he amended quickly
with an embarrassed grin, “come sprinting
into the library and begin to cut me
loose, why I just couldn’t believe my eyes!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Some wonderworker, isn’t she?” Dorothy
contrived to look awestruck, but there
was no malice in her amused tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You said it—she’s a whizbang! And
she told me you two came in an airplane.
I’ve never met a girl aviator before. I
guess she’s a second Dorothy Dixon—you
must have read what the newspapers said
about that girl!” He shook his head admiringly.
“Betty sure has nerve!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She has, indeed!” Dorothy kept her
face straight with an effort. “But tell
me—what did you do to that crew outside?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Plugged ’em—clean. Got a bead on
them through a front window.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What? You—killed them? Buckshot,
at that distance?”</p>

<p class='c008'>George chuckled. “Not buckshot—rock
salt. Use it for crows, you know. It
stings like the dickens.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll bet it does!” Dorothy’s laugh was
full-throated and hearty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s become of them?” she asked
when she could speak.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They beat it around the house to the
garage. Do you know what happened to
their car?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes. It ran away—down the lots to
the bottom of the valley. And between you
and me and the hatrack, I don’t think it will
ever run any more.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gee whiz!” chuckled George. “Who’d
ever think a little thing like Betty would
have the pluck to pull a stunt like that!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who would?” said Dorothy and joined
in the laugh.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, as long as their car is out of the
running, they’ll probably try to steal my
flivver.” George tapped his gun significantly,
“But I’ll put a crimp in that.
They’ve got to pass the dining room windows
to get out of here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You needn’t bother—the Ford won’t
move.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure it will.” George stopped short in
the doorway and turned toward her. “That
car of mine runs like a watch.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But not without gas,” explained Dorothy.
“I drained the tank into a couple of
tins.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You did?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure thing. Parked the tins in your
orchard. They’ll never find ’em.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say!” exclaimed George. “You must
be almost as good as Betty that is, I
mean—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who’s taking my name in vain?” Miss
Mayo was tripping blithely downstairs.
“You two seem to be finding a lot to talk
about.”</p>

<p class='c008'>George stared at her. “Say, you certainly
look swell when you’re dolled up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, it’s the best I can do now,” deprecated
Betty. “I borrowed a pair of your
slippers though—woolly ones. That is, I
s’pose they’re yours?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Glad to have you wear ’em.” George’s
eyes were still glued to Betty’s pretty face
when Dorothy broke in.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look here, we’ll have to get down to
business. George—listen to me. Betty
won’t melt, you know—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I think you’re terrible—” interrupted
Betty.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her friend paid no attention, but kept
on talking to George. “Do you really
think they’ve gone?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He nodded. “I’m pretty sure they
have—that is, for the present. You can’t
do a whole lot when your hide is full of
salt. I’ll bet they’re kiting down the road
right now. Maybe they’ll stop in at the Robinson’s
or somewhere and get a lift to Stamford
or Ridgefield or wherever they came
from. They may have some pals about
here, of course. I sort of gathered that they
weren’t working on their own—that there
was somebody in back of them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, at least we can count on a
breather. Let’s go in the library and turn
on the light. I’m tired of standing about
in this hall and I want to dry out by the
fire.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In the library, George pushed a couple
of easy chairs before the comforting blaze.
Dorothy cast aside her slicker and helmet
and dropped into one of them. She kicked
off her sodden shoes and stretching her legs
toward the warmth, drew forth a comb
and proceeded to make herself neat.
George perched on the arm of Betty’s
chair, and the two stared at the flames without
speaking.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last Dorothy put her comb away,
turned to George and broke the silence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s none of my particular business, of
course, but would you mind telling me the
reason for all this rough house? Why did
those men attack you and tie you up—what
were they doing around here?”</p>

<p class='c008'>George shook his head slowly. “Hanged
if I know,” he said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You don’t know? But they seemed to
be asking you questions—from what I
could see through the window, it looked
that way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s right. But—but—well, you two
girls are real sportsmen. You’ve pulled
me out of an awful mess. Heaven knows
I appreciate what you’ve done, but I just
can’t have you running any further risk
on my account, Miss—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dixon,” supplied Betty. “I forgot you
hadn’t been introduced.”</p>

<p class='c008'>George leaned forward. “Do you come
from New Canaan?” he shot out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course, we live there,” said Betty.
“And I want you to know that Dorothy is
my best friend. We’re seniors at the New
Canaan High—if that interests you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So <em>you’re</em> Dorothy Dixon, the flyer!”
he exploded. “Suffering monkeys! I
didn’t know I was entertaining a celebrity.
Why, you’re the girl I was talking about—who—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here, here—don’t make me blush,”
laughed Dorothy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But don’t you see? Your being Dorothy
Dixon makes all the difference in the
world.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy’s eyebrows drew together in a
puzzled frown.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t get you,” she said. “I really
don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, if what the newspapers say is
true, you simply eat up this gangster
stuff—a whiz at solving all kinds of mysteries.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nice lady-like reputation, what?” she
mocked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, that’s all right with me. Because
now—I have no hesitancy in telling you all
I know about this queer business. You’ll
probably know just what to do—and you’ll
be a wonderful help.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How about me?” Betty was a direct
little person and seemed at no pains to disguise
her feelings. “I don’t think you’re
a bit polite, George!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I feel differently about you—”
stammered that young man, then stopped
short and looked painfully embarrassed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy thought it time she took matters
into her own hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t be silly, Betty, George knows
how clever you are!” She flashed a mischievous
glance at her friend, then went
on in a serious tone. “And of course we’re
keen to hear all about it, George, and we’ll
do anything we can to help you. But your
story will keep a while longer. I hope you
don’t mind my mentioning such a prosaic
thing—but do you happen to have anything
to eat in the house?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, my gosh! Of course I have—” he
threw a glance at the clock and jumped to
his feet. “It’s nearly eight o’clock. You
girls must be starved! Sit right here and
I’ll bring supper in a jiffy. I was just
about to eat mine when those two thugs
dropped in and put an end to it for the
time being.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll help you,” offered Betty, hopping
out of her chair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s a good plan,” decreed Dorothy.
“While you’re starting things in the
kitchen, I’d like to use the phone, if I may.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There it is, on that table in the corner,”
said George. “Hop to it. I’ll drive you
home later in the flivver.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thanks, but I’ve got to have gas for
my plane. We’ll talk it over at supper,
shall we?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She took up the telephone and the others
hurried from the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Presently she joined them in the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I called up your mother, Betty, and
told her you were spending the night with
me,” she announced. “Dad is away, so I
got hold of Bill Bolton and he’ll be over
here in about twenty minutes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, fine—” began Betty and stopped
short as an electric bell on the wall buzzed
sharply.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a moment they stared at it in startled
silence. Then George spoke. “Somebody’s
ringing the door bell,” he said
slowly.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch04' class='c009'><i>Chapter IV</i><br /> <br />VISITORS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“You girls stay in here—I’ll go,” continued
George, his hand on the swinging
door to the dining room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, you shan’t!” Betty sprang before
him, blocking his way.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t make such a fuss,” said Dorothy.
“Somebody’s got to go. Come here!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her long arm shot out and Betty was
held in a light embrace that seemed as unbending
as tempered steel.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stop wriggling,” she commanded.
“This is George’s job. Did you leave your
gun in the library, George?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes. I’ll pick it up on the way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Better not do that. Maybe it’s one of
your neighbors.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Haven’t any. None of the people
around here come to see me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The bell buzzed loudly again, and continued
to do so. Someone was keeping a
finger pressed on the button beside the
front door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have a plan,” Dorothy announced
suddenly. “Betty, you stay here, and—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And have them break in the back door
while you two are in the front hall? No
thanks—I’m coming with you, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy did not stop to argue. She hurried
into the dining room and across the
hall to the library, followed by the others.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look here,” she whispered, picking up
the shotgun. “Slip on your jacket,
George. That shirt will show anyone
you’ve been in a fight. Betty and I will
go into the front sitting room. It’s dark in
there. Turn on the hall light and open
the door as though everything were all
right, and you expected a friend. If it is
someone you know, they won’t see us in
the sitting room. If it isn’t—and they try
to start something, jump back so you’re out
of line from the door to that room ...
and I’ll fill ’em full of salt!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Swell idea! A regular flank attack!”
enthused the young man, struggling into
his coat. “All set?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He switched on the hall light. The girls
ran into the sitting room. Dorothy stood
in the dark with the shotgun pointed toward
the hall and saw him turn the key
and pull open the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good evening, George,” whined a
high-pitched voice. “Mind if I come in
for a minute or two?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Walk in, Mr. Lewis. Bad night, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>George’s face showed surprise but he
swung the door wide and closed it with a
bang as a tall figure, leaning heavily on
a cane, shuffled into the lighted hallway.
The man’s bent back, rounded shoulders
and the rather long white hair that hung
from beneath the wide brim of his soft black
hat, all bespoke advanced age. Immensely
tall, even with his stoop, the old man towered
over George, who was all of six feet
himself. Although the night was not cold,
he was buttoned to the chin in a long fur
coat. Dorothy caught sight of piercing
black eyes beneath tufted white eyebrows.
The long, cadaverous, clean shaven face
was a network of fine wrinkles.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What say?” He cupped a hand behind
his ear.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I said it was a bad night to be out in,”
shouted George. “What can I do for you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, that’s it, my lad—there’s something
I—Yes, it’s a bad night—bad storm.
Listen, George!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What say?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m listening, Mr. Lewis.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, listen then.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The sharp eyes peered up and down the
hall. Dorothy moved further back into
the dark room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your father had a lot of books,
George—a very fine library.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, he had.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What say?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I said he had.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The old man shook his head. His high
voice became querulous.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know he’s dead,” he snorted. “I’m
talking about his books.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They are not for sale,” said George.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bless you—I don’t want to buy ’em.
But there’s one I want to borrow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Which one is that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What say?”</p>

<p class='c008'>George’s reply <em>sotto voce</em> was not polite.
He was getting impatient.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want to borrow a book called Aircraft
Power Plants; it’s by a man named
Jones.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy pricked up her ears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right,” shouted George. “I’ll try
to find it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What say? Listen, George! Speak
distinctly, if you can. I’m not deaf—just
a little hard of hearing. Don’t mumble—you
talk as though your mouth was full of
hot potato. That’s a bad eye you’ve got—been
in a fight?”</p>

<p class='c008'>George ignored this last. “Listen—” he
said, then stopped, controlling a desire to
giggle as he realized his plagiarism.
“Come into the library, Mr. Lewis. I’ll
try to find the book for you.” He took the
old man by the arm and led him down the
hall.</p>

<p class='c008'>Betty crept over to Dorothy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you know who he is?” she asked in
a low tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Lewis, I gathered,” said Dorothy,
straining her ears to catch the muffled
sounds coming from the library. “<em>He</em>
talked loud enough,—quite an old gentleman,
isn’t he?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Old skinflint, you mean.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ve seen him before?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Certainly. I’ve seen him at our house.
Daddy knows him—says he’s made a fortune,
foreclosing mortgages and loaning
money at high rates of interest. He’s terribly
rich, though you’d never know it by
his looks.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s interesting—wonder what he
wants with George?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Came to borrow a book—that’s plain
enough.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Almost too plain, if you want my
opinion,” Dorothy said thoughtfully.
“There’s no use guessing at this stage of
the game.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are you talking about?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, nothing much. Can you hear
what they’re saying in the next room?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They seem to be having an argument—but
it’s not polite to listen—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Polite, your grandmother! I’d listen
if I could—but all I get is a mumble-jumble.
I vote we go back to the kitchen.
I want my supper. I’ll feel better when
I’ve eaten. This house gives me the jim-jams
for some reason.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Me, too,” Betty admitted ungrammatically.
“Fancy being alarmed at the
sound of a doorbell!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My word—and likewise cheerio!”
Dorothy turned the flash on her friend.
“How do you get that way, Betty? Been
reading the British poets or something?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Betty blinked in the glare. “Turn it off.
No, I haven’t. Don’t you remember the
movies last night? The English Duke in
that picture—” She broke off suddenly
and caught at Dorothy’s arm. “Listen—Dot,
listen!” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the rear of the house came a
muffled pounding.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy shook her off. “I’ll dot you a
couple, if you take liberties with my
name,” she snapped. “And for goodness’
sake, don’t hold on to me that way, and stop
that listen stuff! This isn’t an earthquake—somebody’s
at the back door, and I’m going
to see who it is!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But suppose those men have come
back?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’re too well salted down,” Dorothy
flung back at her. “I <em>fancy</em> you’d
better stay in here—if you’re <em>alarmed</em>!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She crossed the hall to the dining room
again and hurried through the kitchen with
Betty close on her trail. That young person
apparently preferred to chance it rather
than be left alone.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy went at once to the back door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who’s there?” she called, as the knocking
broke out again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s Bill Bolton,” returned a muffled
voice. “Is that you, Dorothy?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She drew back the bolt and flung the
door open.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hello, Bill!” she hailed. “You’re just
in time for supper.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A tall, broadshouldered young fellow
wearing golf trousers and an old blue
sweater which sported a Navy “N”
came into the room. He was bareheaded
and his thick, close-cropped thatch of hair
was brown. When he smiled, Bill Bolton
was handsome. A famous ace and traveller
at seventeen, this friend of Dorothy’s
had not been spoiled by notoriety. His
keen gray eyes twinkled goodnaturedly as
he spoke to Dorothy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I should say you look pretty
much at home,” he grinned. “But then
you have a faculty of landing on your
feet. And how’s Betty tonight? Thought
I’d find you girls in a tight fix and here
you are—getting up a banquet. Terry
Walters was over at my house when you
rang up, so he came with me. He’s outside,
playing second line defense. All
sereno here, I take it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Quiet enough now,” Dorothy admitted,
“though it was a bit hectic, to say
the least, a while back. Call Terry in, will
you? I’m going to do some scrambled
eggs and bacon now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She reached for a bowl and began to
crack eggs and break them into it. Bill
stuck his head out the door and whistled.</p>

<p class='c008'>A moment later, a heavy set, round
faced lad of sixteen made his appearance
in the doorway. Under his arm he carried
a repeating rifle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“H’lo, everybody,” he breezed, resting
his rifle against the wall. “This is some
surprise,—Bill and I were all set to play
the heavy heroes and we find you making
fudge!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not fudge,” corrected Betty. “Honest-to-goodness
food! Dorothy and I haven’t
had a single thing to eat since lunch, except
a lettuce sandwich and some cake at
Helen Ritchie’s tea over at Peekskill this
afternoon. We’re getting supper now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>We?</em>” Dorothy’s tone was richly sarcastic.
“Then, old dear, suppose you do
some of the getting. I think I heard the
front door shut just now, so that means that
old Mr. Lewis has shoved off. You can go
into the dining room and set the table.—Bill,
you’re a good cook—how about starting
the coffee? Terry, be a sport and cut
some bread—you might toast it while
you’re about it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whew!—some efficiency expert!”
Terry winked at Bill. “Where do they keep
the bread box in this house, anyway?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Barks her orders like a C.P.O. doesn’t
she?” laughed Bill, opening the coffee tin.
Then he drew forth a wax-paper wrapped
loaf from an enameled container, held it
up: “Here’s your bread, Terry—catch!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The door from the dining room swung
open and George came in.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, George!” Dorothy turned to the
others. “Here is our host,” she explained
and introduced him all round.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s certainly white of you fellows to
hustle over here,” he said as he shook
hands. “I appreciate it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, don’t mention it,” grinned Bill.
“We seem to be rather late for the excitement.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, if it hadn’t been for Betty and
Dorothy—” began George.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’d have pulled yourself out all
right,” interrupted the latter young lady.
“Look here, supper’s nearly ready, and
since I’ve set everybody else to work, suppose
I give you a job, too? Take Betty
into the dining room and show her how
to set the table, and you’ll be a fine help.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, it’s great, the way you’ve pitched
in here—did you have a hard time finding
things?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, not at all. Except—” here Dorothy
looked stern, “I don’t approve of your
housekeeping methods—I had to scour the
frying pan twice, sir, do you realize that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>George hung his head. “Gee, I guess
I’m pretty careless, but—”</p>

<p class='c008'>The cook giggled: “Mercy, you look
downcast. I was only kidding, George.
I think you’re a fine housekeeper, honestly,
I do. Now you get a wiggle on with the
table, please. These eggs are nearly finished.
They’ll be ruined if we have to
wait.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When the two had disappeared, Dorothy
dished the scrambled eggs into a warm
plate and turned to Bill and Terry.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He thinks Betty ran this job,” she informed
them. “They’ve got a crush on
each other, I guess. So don’t put him
wise, will you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mum’s the word,” smiled Bill, while
Terry nodded. “Far be it from me to mess
up love’s young dream.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t be silly,” retorted Dorothy. “But
you know, Betty’s a darling. I had to be
terribly cross with her all the time, just to
keep her bucked up. But she’s my best
friend and I’m crazy about her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She is nervous and high-strung, I
know,” supplemented Terry. “I’ll bet
you had a sweet time with her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not so bad. Have you boys had supper?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes, some time ago,” answered Bill.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s good. I didn’t want to use up
all George’s food. I’ll let you have some
coffee, though—that is, if you’re good and
don’t kid those two in the other room.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Cross-my-heart-hope-to-die-if-I-do.”
Bill’s face was solemn.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Likewise me,” declaimed Terry. “I
must have my coffee.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Table’s set,” announced Betty, popping
in to the kitchen, closely followed by
George.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Eggs are finished and the bacon’s
fried,” returned Dorothy. “How about
the coffee, Bill?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perfect—though I sez so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>And</em> the toast!” Terry was busy buttering
the last slice. “You know, lovers
used to write sonnets on their lady’s eyebrows—now,
if they’d seen this toast!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy shook her head at him. “That
will be about all from you. Come along,
all of you—everything smells so good, and
I’m simply ravenous.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a merry party that gathered about
the old mahogany dining table. Bill began
by teasing Dorothy about her lack of
foresight that sent her up on a flight without
enough gas. She returned his banter
with interest: the others joined in and for
a time everybody was wisecracking back
and forth.</p>

<p class='c008'>George was the first to bring the conversation
back to current events.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know Mr. Lewis very well,” he
replied in answer to a question of Betty’s.
“He was a friend of my father’s—at least
father had business dealings with him. I
thought I’d never get rid of the old boy
tonight.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you find the book he wanted?”
asked Dorothy. “Jones’ Aircraft Power
Plants, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Some book, too!” affirmed Bill. “Have
you read it, Conway?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Didn’t know I owned it. The book—in
fact, the whole library, was my father’s.
About all he saved from the wreck. When
I couldn’t find the book for old Lewis,
what do you think he said?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Listen!’” Dorothy’s voice mimicked
perfectly the old gentleman’s querulous
tones. Everyone burst into laughter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, he said that,” George told her,
“and a whole lot more.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hate riddles,” cried Betty. “Do tell
us—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, he wanted to buy the entire library—and
when I turned him down, he
made me an offer on the house providing
entire contents went with it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Betty laughed. “A good low price, I’ll
bet. Mr. Lewis is a terrible old skinflint.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I thought so, too, until he made me this
offer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you mind saying how much?”
Dorothy never hesitated to come to the
point.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Twenty-five thousand dollars!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Seems like a lot of money to me!” was
Bill’s comment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A lot of money! I should say so.”
George cried excitedly. “Why, this place
isn’t worth more than eight—possibly ten
thousand dollars at the outside.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I smell a rat,” said Terry, “or to put it
more politely, the old boy’s offer has something
doggoned stinking crooked mixed
up in it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“To add to our cultured brother’s oratory,”
said Bill, “There certainly seems to
be something pretty darned putrid in the
kingdom of Denmark!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A whole lot nearer home, if you ask
me,” broke in Dorothy.—“That old
man—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just a moment,” begged Bill. “Your
deductions, Miss Dixon, are always noteworthy.
In fact, at times, the press of our
glorious country has frequently referred
to you as Miss Sherlock Holmes, but—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Cut the comedy, Bill!” broke in the object
of this effusion. “What is it you’re
driving at?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Simply, as I was saying when so rudely
interrupted, that your deductions and ideas
on this business may be Aland a yard wide,
but except for what you shot at me over the
telephone, both Terry and I are wading
about in a thick pea soup fog, so to speak.
Suppose you give us your account of these
mysterious happenings. That should put
us ‘hep’ to the situation, and then George
can tell us his end of the story, why he got
tied up by these blokes and all that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>George did not appear cheerful. “But I
don’t know—” he protested. “Haven’t the
slightest idea.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So Dorothy said over the phone. But
perhaps if you start far enough back—give
us the story of your life, as it were—we
may be able to dig out a motive.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“At times you show positively human intelligence,
Bill!” Dorothy yawned, without
apology. “Well, here goes! Maybe if Bill
will let me get a few words in edgewise, I
may forget I’m so sleepy!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch05' class='c009'><i>Chapter V</i><br /> <br />THE MOTIVE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“And then I opened the back door and
found you standing there, Bill. Phew!”
Dorothy ended with a sigh. “It’s almost
more of an effort in the telling than it was
in the doing!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wouldn’t believe it if I didn’t know it
was true,” declared Terry solemnly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ve the great gift of stating things
clearly, Terry,” remarked Bill Bolton. “In
other words, why must you put in your foot
every time you open your mouth? Dorothy,
my girl, you said your piece nicely.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m not your girl, thank heaven! If
I was at all interested, I’d certainly burst
into tears. Please don’t try to be humorous—it’s
painful, positively painful.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess I’d better begin my story,”
George decided diplomatically. “Or
somebody’s likely to start throwing things.
Where do you want me to start?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Like this,” volunteered Terry, setting
his empty coffee cup on its saucer. “‘I
was born an orphan at the age of four, of
poor but dishonest parents....’”</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘And until the age of thirteen and
three-quarters, could only walk sideways
with my hair parted in the middle,’” came
George’s quick follow up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s all right,” decreed Bill. “Let him
speak his piece, gang—this is going to be
good.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of all the conceited nerve!” exclaimed
Dorothy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do shut up and give George a chance,”
broke in Betty heatedly. “I want to hear
about it—and this is a serious matter, I—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now you’re the one who’s stopping
him,” accused her chum. “For goodness’
sake, get going, George—we’ve got to
drive to New Canaan some time tonight.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right,” said George. “If you
people don’t find it interesting, well, you’ve
brought it on yourselves. Surprising as it
may seem, I was born at the usual age at
‘Hilltop,’ that big whitehouse on the
ridge, overlooking the other side of the reservation.
Father, you know, was an inventor.
He was always an extremely reticent
man and I realized as I grew older
that he was very much of a recluse. He
never spoke to Mother and me about his
inventions, but they must have brought
him a good income. We kept up that big
place and had plenty of servants, although
we entertained very little. After I got
through the nursery stage, I had a French
governess and later a tutor. Mother and
I were great pals. She must have been a
busy woman, for she superintended the
running of our model farm and dairy, but
she was never too occupied with her duties
but what she had time to romp and play
with me. I know now that she must have
led a very lonely life.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My father spent nine-tenths of the time
in his laboratory and workshop. He did
not encourage friends or acquaintances
and he never went anywhere with Mother.
He had but one hobby, his work, and although
I know he was very fond of us, the
work came first. Even later, when I grew
up, he never seemed like the fathers of
other fellows I knew. It was his reticence
and absolute absorption in those inventions
of his that kept us practically strangers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Five years ago last spring, when I was
twelve, Mother died. Her heart had never
been strong—her going took the only person
I really loved away from me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>George was unable to go on for a moment,
and Betty caught his hand under the
table and held it. The tenderhearted little
girl was very near to tears. George smiled
manfully, then went on with his recital.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sorry,” he apologized for his show of
feeling, “I never quite got over losing
Mother. My governess had been replaced
by a tutor a couple of years before this, but
now Father decided I was to go to boarding
school. So I was packed off to Lawrenceville,
a homesick, lonely little kid if
there ever was one. I’d never been thrown
with boys of my own age before—I guess
I was pretty much of a young prig—but
as the poet says, ‘I soon learned different.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“During the holidays I used mostly to
come back to Hilltop. Father never made
a kick if I brought fellows back with me.
We had the run of the place, which he kept
up just as it had been when Mother was
alive. One thing was understood though:
he must not be annoyed by my guests.
There were saddle horses, for he rode regularly
every morning before breakfast; cars
to drive, and he also belonged to the club
over at Bedford, although I don’t think he
had ever seen the place. He gave me
plenty of money to spend and always allowed
me to accept invitations from other
fellows to visit at their homes. Altogether
I had a pretty good time. The only trouble
was that Father never took any real interest
in me. I was lucky enough to get my
‘L’ at football, but he never came down
to Lawrenceville—not even to see a
game.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve got your number, now!” cried
Terry, interrupting him. “You’re Stoker
Conway! I thought I’d seen you before.
Say, Bill, this guy is too modest. ‘Lucky
to make his letter,’ I don’t think! Conway
captained the Lawrenceville team last
season. My cousin, Ed Durham (they call
him Bull Durham down there) played left
tackle. I went down with Dad and Uncle
Harry last fall to see the Princeton freshman-Lawrenceville
game.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I remember your telling about it,” said
Dorothy. “Somebody, I think, made a
sixty-yard run for a touchdown.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll bet George did it,” piped up Betty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He certainly did! And let me tell you,
Angelface, that your boy friend was the
fastest halfback Lawrenceville or any
other school has seen in years. All American
stuff—that’s what he is. Hard luck
you didn’t get to college this year, old
man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can’t always have what we want,” remarked
George philosophically.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who won the game?” asked Bill. “The
one you saw, Terry?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, Lawrenceville, of course.
Smeared ’em—outplayed those freshies
from start to finish and did it with a lighter
team. Thirty-three to nothing—think of
it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy turned toward George.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stoker Conway—I like that name,
‘Stoker.’ How did you get it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>George grinned. “I was a grubby little
mutt—my first term at Lawrenceville.
Somebody pasted the name on me, and it
stuck.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Three celebrities at one table,” sighed
Terry. “I knew we had two with us to-night—but
a third! It’s just too much.
Betty, you and I have just got to do something
to make ourselves famous. There’s
practically no hope for me, I admit, but
you will probably become a movie queen,
when you’re old enough—ash-gold hair
and a baby doll face are all the rage on the
screen!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I don’t know,” hit back Betty, ignoring
the laughter caused by this left
handed compliment. “How about the
fame you won in the diamond smuggling
case? You got plenty of newspaper publicity
then.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This sally turned the laugh on Terry, for
as the three others knew, he had played
anything but an heroic part in that episode.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Terry was a jolly soul and his hearty
laugh at his own expense joined with the
others.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lay off, Betty!” he cried, “that was one
below the belt. What do you bet I spot the
motive in this mysterious case of Stoker’s?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“See here, will you pipe down?” Bill expostulated.
“All you will spot is your
clothes. Keep quiet and quit waving your
arms—you nearly upset my coffee. How
can any of us learn anything unless you
give Stoker a chance to get on with his
story?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Terry suppressed a retort and George
hurried into the breach.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here goes on the second installment,
then,” he said. “And it will probably interest
you all to know I’m pretty near the
end. Let’s see—where was I?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Last fall, at Lawrenceville,” prompted
Dorothy. “You couldn’t get your father
to come down there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>George nodded. “Yes, that’s right. He
never would come—not even when I graduated
last June. I wrote him specially
about it, but, well, he was having his own
troubles about that time. Before I came
home I passed my finals for Princeton. It
was on the books that I’d go there this fall.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Only I didn’t,” continued young Conway
rather solemnly. “Father met me at
the Bedford station in the flivver when I
came back. On the way up here he told
me that reverses in business had forced him
to sell Hilltop. I knew, of course, that
business conditions were pretty bad all
over the country. But he looked ill and
he had aged terribly since I’d seen him
during the Easter holidays. I was much
more worried about his physical condition,
he seemed so played out, so feeble. But
when we drove into the yard and I saw
this down-at-the-heels old house—well, I
certainly got another shock.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It must have been terribly hard,” sympathized
Betty. “Especially after living
all your life in the big place on the hill.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A bit of a comedown,” acknowledged
George, “but I don’t want any of you to
think I was ashamed of the place. If
Father had to live here, it was good enough
for me. I felt so sorry for him, though.
He’d never been much of a mixer, as I
said, but when he did talk to a fellow he
was certainly interesting, full of pep and
vitality—and a sure hog for work. Now
all that was changed. He had no workshop
or laboratory here. All day long and
half the night he would sit reading in the
library across the hall. If I spoke to him,
he would answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to a question—but
never volunteered anything on
his own account. He seemed more like a
man stunned—a man who realizes his life
is a failure and no longer cares to go on.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The woman down the road who cooks
and keeps the house clean told me he had
moved in here the early part of April and
that during the time before I came back,
he had been exactly as I found him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wanted to get a job in the city. Even
though I couldn’t get him to talk about his
affairs, I knew he couldn’t have very much
money, living in a ramshackle place like
this. But though I wanted to get out and
earn some money, I realized I must stay
with him for the time being—and I’m glad
I did. Father passed away in his sleep the
night of July fourth. The doctor said it
was his heart—like Mother.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I guess that’s about all of it.
When the will was read I found that he’d
left me everything. It amounted to two
thousand dollars in cash, and this house
and the sixteen acres that go with it. I
stuck on here for the rest of the summer,
trying to get the place in better shape; gave
the house a couple of coats of paint, re-shingled
parts of the roof, and have done
as much as I could. I’m trying to sell the
place, you know, and the agent told me I
could never do it unless it was put in better
condition. It looks pretty bad still, but I’ve
worked like a dog.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I forgot to say, that Mr. Lewis
bought Hilltop from father. He drops in
here every once in a while for a chat. I
know he’s got a reputation for being a
skinflint, but I sort of like the old man, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy, who had been absent-mindedly
rolling bread pills on the table cloth, threw
him a sharp glance.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What happened tonight, before we
came?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, I was just about to get my supper,
when the bell rang. I opened the door and
those two guys jumped me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not very subtle, were they? What do
you suppose they were after?” Bill looked
inquiringly at George.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, this is the funny part of it all.
They said they’d come for the letter Father
had left for me to read after his death—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And you didn’t give it to them?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d never even heard of such a letter. I
told them so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And they wouldn’t believe you, eh?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They thought I was bluffing, of
course.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But how on earth—did they say anything
about the contents of the letter?”
This question came from Dorothy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No. Simply that they wanted it—and
they knew I must have it. What I can’t understand
is how they could be so sure that
a letter exists—even if I’d known about
it, I wouldn’t have given it to them—but
it’s all as clear as mud to me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Has Mr. Lewis ever spoken to you
about it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you any reason to suppose that
your Father might have left a letter for
you—any idea that he might have had an
important message to convey to you in that
way?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not the slightest. You see, I—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look here,” broke in Terry. “Do you
think it possible that old Lewis knew that
your Father wrote you that letter—and believes
that it’s in this house? He might
have hired those thugs to get it from you,
then when he found out they failed, he
hopped over here himself and made that
offer to buy your place, in order to get hold
of it? There may be something valuable
contained in it, and he wants to get it at any
cost.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Too crude,” declared Dorothy with a
shake of her head. “Perhaps he does want
to buy it—but I doubt if he has anything to
do with those holdup fellows. Mr. Lewis
may be close but I’m sure he’s a clever man.
The very fact that he came here so soon
after the fracas clears his skirts of trying to
hold up Stoker. As I say, he may want
to get hold of the letter himself, but I’m
dead sure he’s not the nigger in this particular
woodpile.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then who is?” Terry wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell us that, and you’ll win the fame
you’re after,” chuckled Betty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just a moment,” Bill was speaking
again. “If old Lewis is as clever as you
think he is, Dorothy, then the smart thing
for him to do would be exactly what he <em>has</em>
done!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How’s that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, if he did hire those lads, he might
figure that by coming over here, Stoker’d
begin to believe he was the man behind the
gun. <em>But</em>, he might have realized that on
second thought, Stoker would discount the
idea, for the very reason you have done
so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gosh!” exploded Terry. “That’s a
stumper, Bill. What are we going to do
about it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s the question—<em>can</em> we do anything?”
Dorothy flicked a bread pill
across the table.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch06' class='c009'><i>Chapter VI</i><br /> <br />CORNERED</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“There’s one thing about it,” Bill Bolton
told the others seated at the supper
table. “This letter that Mr. Conway is supposed
to have written to Stoker is at the
bottom of all this queer business.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But that doesn’t get us anywhere, does
it?” objected Terry. “We must find out
what that letter’s about. Get hold of the
underlying motive, you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, you got that out of a detective
story—‘underlying motive’—I know you
did.” Betty shook an accusing finger at
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, what of it? That’s the thing
we’ve got to do—and I guess it doesn’t matter
how you say it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Enter Doctor Watson!” Bill grinned
and winked at Dorothy. “Look out for
your laurels, Miss Sherlock Holmes!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, come on—this isn’t any jazz number,”
she returned with spirit. “What’s
your big idea, Terry?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, hunt for the letter of course.
When we find it, we’ll have the—ahem!—underlying
motive as well.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe. Who’s going to do the hunting?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All of us. We’ll each take a room,
and—”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy laughed. “You’re some organizer.
Suppose you start in with the library.
It won’t take you more than a week to go
through all the books in that room!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But listen, Dorothy—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t be absurd. We’ll have a hunt
tomorrow, if you want. But Betty and I
have got to get home now—and anyway, I
know where that letter is.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The four about the table stared at her
in unfeigned amazement.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>Where?</em>” they cried in chorus.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll give each of you three guesses,” she
went on mischievously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, don’t be horrid,” pleaded Betty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You know we’re absolutely up a
tree—” chimed in George.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on and tell,” invited Bill.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How did you find out?” added Terry.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Simply by keeping my eyes and ears
open,” retorted the object of this wordy
bombardment, “and by knowing that two
and two make four, not sometimes, but all
the time. Every one of you has heard as
much about this as I have tonight, and
every one, excepting Stoker, has kidded me
because I found out some things about the
bank robbery and that smuggling gang
this summer. Now you won’t even take
the trouble to think for yourselves. The
whereabouts of that letter is clear enough;
to be able to put our hands on it, is something
quite different.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I apologize for us all,” Bill
leaned across the table, “we were only kidding
you—weren’t we, Betty?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, of course—she knows that, she’s
only trying to—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on, Dorothy,” Terry coaxed her
with a grin.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The letter is—?” George asked soberly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy pursed her lips, then smiled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In your father’s copy of Jones’ Aircraft
Power Plants,” she replied calmly.
“Find that book, which Mr. Lewis was so
keen to locate that he offered to buy this
house in order to get it—and you’ll have
the letter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I believe you’re right,” conceded Bill,
“you generally are—but that book is going
to take some finding, or I’ve got another
guess coming.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If there really is a letter and it’s in the
book,” said George, “Mr. Lewis must have
hired those men.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not necessarily,” returned Dorothy,
“but I’ll admit it’s possible.”</p>

<p class='c008'>George’s face wore a puzzled frown.
“What I can’t understand is why outsiders
should know about this letter, when I have
never heard of it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And if your father really wrote a letter
to you, and they knew it—why did they
wait nearly three months before they tried
to steal it?” Bill shook his head. “It’s
beyond me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And why did they start in using strong
arm stuff right off the bat?” Terry propounded
this question to the table at large.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I think it is the most mysterious
thing I ever heard of,” said Betty, struggling
to stifle a yawn.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy stood up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, we can’t talk about it any longer
tonight. Betty and I must be getting
home.” She turned to Bill. “Did you bring
some extra gas for <em>Wispy</em>?” she asked.
“From the sound of things outside, the
storm seems to be pretty well over. I don’t
want to leave the plane in that woodlot all
night. Some tramp might come across her
and bust something.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve brought enough gas to fly back to
New Canaan and then some. I’ll go with
you in the plane.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How about me?” Betty looked surprised,
yet oddly hopeful.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Terry’ll drive you home,” said Bill.</p>

<p class='c008'>George looked disappointed, but voiced
no objection to the plan, and Betty merely
shrugged.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy spoke up quickly. “No, I think
you’d better stay here tonight, Terry. Somebody
ought to stay here with George ...
pardon me, Stoker! But as it’s Sunday to-morrow,
there’s no school to get up early
for, and Stoker can drive Betty over to my
house and come back here. Bill and I will
bring her over after breakfast and we can
see what we can do to locate that letter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good plan,” agreed young Conway enthusiastically.
“I’ll be back in less than
an hour.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But who’s going to wash all these
dishes?” grumbled Terry.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not afraid to stay here, are you?” said
Dorothy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, if you put it that way I’ll wash
them,” he retorted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You do ’em tonight, and we’ll do ’em
tomorrow—but we really must be going
now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ten minutes later, Betty and George
chugged out of the drive in his flivver.
Terry parked Bill’s car in back of the
house, then he helped his friend to lift out
the three large tins of gasoline they had
brought with them from New Canaan.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll take two,” announced Bill, “and
you’ll have to tote the other one, Dorothy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hadn’t I better carry it down the hill?”
suggested Terry. “It’s kind of heavy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, thanks, I can manage it all right.”
She lifted the can by its handle. “It’s not
so heavy. Your job is to stay in the house.
As it is, I hate leaving you here alone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Terry waved them off.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll be all right,” he scoffed. “I think
we’ve got those guys buffaloed—for the
time being, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Keep your rifle handy,” advised Bill,
“and don’t open up to anyone except
Stoker.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You bet I won’t.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good night, then—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And good luck,” added Dorothy,
switching on her flash.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good night, both of you—see you in the
morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He watched their light travel into the
orchard and turned back to the empty
house.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy and Bill reached the rear wall
of the orchard and came to a stop. Although
the storm had passed and with it
the driving rain, heavy cloud formations
obscured the stars.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Better hop over the fence, Dorothy,”
said Bill, “then I’ll pass these containers
across to you. Gee whiz! It sure is some
black night. You came up this way, didn’t
you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yep.” Dorothy’s voice came from the
other side where her light was flashing.
“Hand over the cans. That’s right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill joined her and picked up his load
again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The ground slopes down to the valley
from here,” she said. “Drops would be
a better word, I guess. It goes down like
the side of a roof. Watch your step! This
wet grass is slippery as ice.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve found that out,” said Bill, sitting
down suddenly. “Which way is that woodlot
trail from here?” He got to his feet.
The tins had saved him from a bad tumble.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Off to the right—down in the valley.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then let’s steer off that way. Take this
hill on the oblique. It’s easier walking.
By the way, which side of the river have
you got the bus parked?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“River? What river? I didn’t know
there was one.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, there is. Stone Hill River, it’s
called. If you didn’t cross it going up to
Stoker’s house, the plane must be on this
side.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ve got a master mind,” she retorted
and her light went out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Followed your example, and sat down.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The light flashed on again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Aren’t hurt, are you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t be personal,” she laughed.
“How did you know there was a river
down in the valley?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, I brought a map of the Reservation
with me—studied it on the way over
while Terry drove. We’d never have
found that dirt road Stoker’s house is on
otherwise. Part of it is really in the Reservation,
you see. The concrete road from
Poundridge Village that runs to South
Salem parallels it about a quarter of a mile
to the east.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Route 124,” said Dorothy, walking
carefully for fear of slipping again. “I
know that road. Ever been in the Reservation,
Bill?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No—have you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“When I was a little girl, we used to
drive over, for picnics sometimes. I don’t
remember much about it, though, except
that it’s a terribly wild place—all rocks
and ridges and forest. It covers miles.
The state has cut trails and keeps them
open, otherwise the woods have been left
in their virgin state.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There are cabins, too, the map calls
them shelters,” Bill informed her. “The
state rents them to camping parties. Well,
it’s quite wild enough to suit me right here.
How are you making out?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy was leading the way with her
light.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Fine, thanks. I’m on the level again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Glad to hear that you are,” chuckled
Bill.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Silly! I mean I’m on fairly level
ground again. And look what I’ve found.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her light flashed to the left and came
to rest on the wreck of a seven passenger
closed car.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good enough!” exclaimed Bill. “Those
thugs won’t do any more riding in that bus.
See how the car smashed that big tree—it
must have torn down the hill like greased
lightning!”</p>

<p class='c008'>They deposited their gasoline tins on the
grass and inspected the mass of twisted
metal more closely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hello!” ejaculated Dorothy. “Someone’s
been here before us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How do you figure that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The license plates have been removed.
I know they were on the car when I
sent it down here. I was in such a rush
I forgot to take the number, worse
luck!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Too bad—now we won’t be able to trace
the owner.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes, we will. Unless we’ve got an
unusually clever mind bucking us, I’ll bet
we can trace it through the factory number
and the number of the engine. Give me a
hand, Bill. Let’s get the hood up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Master mind number two,” grunted
Bill when Dorothy’s flash was turned on
the motor. “Him and me both, eh? The
number plate has been removed, and the
one on the engine chiseled off. Those lads
must have had a lovely time doing it, with
their hides full of salt.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy switched off her light with a
click.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>They</em> never came down here, in their
condition,” she said decisively. “It must
have been somebody else—probably the
man who is back of them—or others of that
gang.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Old Lewis?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know. Of course, he himself
couldn’t have done this—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, he’s a bit too old to come traipsing
down to this valley all alone in the dark.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Too bad we’ve showed our light on the
hill and around here just now,” she said
slowly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You think they may still be in the
offing?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope not. Chances are they don’t
know about the plane.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’d better go back to the house,” he
advised. “I can lash two of these tins together
and sling them over my shoulder.
If there’s going to be a shindy, you’ll be
better off up the hill with Terry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thanks a lot,” said Dorothy. “If
there’s going to be trouble, we’ll go it together.
Anyway, you’d never be able to
find the trail to the woodlot in the dark.
It’s great of you to suggest carrying on
without me, but it just can’t be done.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You sure are a good sport, Dorothy.”
Bill picked up his tins. “Where do we go
from here?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Follow me. And the less noise we
make, the better.”</p>

<p class='c008'>With Bill close on her heels, she led
across the clearing toward the dark line of
trees on their left, winding her way around
rocky out-croppings and stunted bushes
that made traveling in the dark a difficult
proceeding.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Think you can find the cart road?” she
heard him whisper. “It’s black as your hat
without the flash.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure can,” she replied cheerfully. “All
we have to do is to turn right at the woods
and follow them up the valley until we
come to it. Quiet, now—if anybody’s,
watching, we may be able to get by them
in the dark.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They had gone another twenty yards or
so, when Dorothy stopped suddenly and
caught at Bill’s arm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s somebody behind that big rock
to the left!” she whispered fiercely. “I’m
sure I saw something move.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You sure did, young lady,” announced a
gruff voice close to their right. “Tell
your girl friend not to make a fuss, Mr.
Conway. My men are all around you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A tall figure, hardly more than a blur
in the darkness, stepped from behind a tree
and came toward them.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch07' class='c009'><i>Chapter VII</i><br /> <br />RAVEN ROCKS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Bill Bolton dropped one of the gasoline
tins he was carrying and grasping the other
with both hands, hurled its heavy bulk at
the stranger. The tin caught the man full
in the chest.</p>

<p class='c008'>As he staggered back, Dorothy felt herself
seized from behind. A quick twist
and pull sent her antagonist hurtling off to
the right. It was not for nothing she had
put in long hours mastering the complicated
throws and holds of jiu jitsu, that
strenuous art of Japanese wrestling.</p>

<p class='c008'>She freed herself in time to see Bill crash
his fist into the face of a third man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on!” he yelled, and they raced
for the line of trees.</p>

<p class='c008'>But their troubles were not over yet.
Straight ahead and directly in their path,
another dark figure was leaping toward
them. There was no time to dodge—to
swerve. Bill dove at the man, stopping
him short and bringing him to the ground
with a clean tackle just above his knees.
The force of contact was terrific. For the
fraction of a second neither the tackler nor
his opponent moved. Then as Dorothy,
trembling with excitement, bent over them,
Bill scrambled to his feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you hurt, Bill?” The girl’s voice
was breathless with concern.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No—only winded—” he gasped. “Be
all right—in a minute.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy gripped him by the arm and
they trotted forward again, gradually increasing
their speed as Bill regained his
breath. From behind them came the calls
and angry shouts of their pursuers.</p>

<p class='c008'>All at once, the inky black blur of the
woods loomed before them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Keep along the edge of this pasture
toward the wood road,” Dorothy whispered
quickly. “I’m going to start a false
trail. Maybe we can fool them. You get
your breath—join you in a minute or two.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She sprang into the underbrush, crashing
over low bushes, snapping dead twigs
and branches under foot with all the clatter
of a terrified cow in a cane brake. Then
the noise stopped as suddenly as it started,
and Bill was surprised to hear her light
footsteps at his heels.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want ’em to think we’re hiding in
there,” she explained hurriedly. “Can you
run now?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You bet!”</p>

<p class='c008'>They sped along the edge of the wood,
spurred by the thought that the ruse would
delay their pursuers and perhaps throw
them off the trail altogether. From their
rear came the sound of a rough voice issuing
commands. Men were beating the
underbrush, cursing in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c008'>Both Dorothy and Bill had got their
second wind and were running much more
easily now. Then Dorothy tripped on the
uneven ground and would have fallen had
not Bill thrust out a steadying hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thanks,” she said jerkily as she ran.
“Look over my shoulder. Lights back
there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wonder they didn’t use ’em before,”
was Bill’s only comment.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy slowed down to a fast walk and
Bill also slackened his pace.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We must be nearly there,” she panted,
“though since we had to drop the gasoline,
there doesn’t seem much use hiking over
to the plane.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill nodded in the darkness. “Think
we’d better get back to the house?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes; they’ll never see us, especially now
that they’ve got their flashlights going—that
glare will blind them. I vote we keep
on along the valley until we pass the wood
road, then swing across this pasture again
and up the hill till we strike the road. That
will take us back to the Conway place
and—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look!” Bill’s exclamation arrested her,
but his warning was unnecessary. Far
above, a sudden rift in the clouds brought
a full moon into view. The woods, the
open pasture and the steep hill down which
they had traveled almost blindly a few
minutes before were now bathed in clear,
silvery light as bright as day. As they
dashed forward again, a shout from behind
told them they had been seen.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stop or we’ll fire!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s the trail, Bill—it’s our only
chance!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Men were calling to each other behind
them and she caught the sound of heavy
feet pounding along in their wake. As she
and Bill turned into the wood road and
sped down its winding stretches under the
arch of intertwining boughs, a revolver
cracked several times in quick succession.
Overhead, the bullets went screaming
through the branches.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shooting high to scare us,” wheezed
Bill. “’Fraid we’re running into a dead
end.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe not—this moonlight won’t last—clouds
too heavy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy wasted no more breath in
speech. Her every effort was centered in
keeping up with the long legged young
fellow who seemed to cover the ground so
easily and at such an amazing rate of speed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Presently they swept out of the wagon-trail
and into the glaring moonlight of the
woodlot. Shouts and calls from their pursuers
but a short distance behind now, lent
wings to their feet. At the far end of the
open space, Dorothy’s amphibian lay
parked where she had left it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not that way!” warned Bill and caught
her arm as she started to swing toward the
airplane. “Straight ahead!”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was no time for argument.
Dorothy swerved and dashed across the lot,
following his lead. Straight ahead lay a
narrow belt of woods which ended abruptly
in precipitous cliffs towering upward
almost perpendicularly for several
hundred feet to the top of the ridge. What
Bill’s plan might be, she could not guess.
Those sheer palisades certainly could not
be scaled. What could his objective be?
If they turned up or down the valley the
enemy would be sure to hear them tracking
through the thick underbrush. And
there would be no chance of outflanking
the pursuit, for the men were between them
and the Conway house.</p>

<p class='c008'>She and Bill were trapped at last—trapped
by walls of rock and the encompassing
passing ring of the enemy.</p>

<p class='c008'>They reached the farther edge of the field
where a hurried glance behind showed
them that the men were plunging out of
the wood road. Then the moon, perhaps
ashamed of the trouble he had brought
them, swam away behind another cloud
formation, and once again the world was
sunk in darkness.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill’s fingers gripped her hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Follow me. Walk carefully and hold
your arm before your face. It’s a case of
feel our way till we get used to the gloom—and
there’s no sense in losing an eye.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He led onward through the wood and
although Dorothy could see nothing but
an opaque blackness before her eyes, Bill
never hesitated in his stride. With his hand
behind his back, he pulled her forward
as though guided by an uncanny knowledge
of invisible obstructions in their path.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How do you do it?” she marveled.
“Don’t tell me you can actually see to
dodge these branches and tree trunks?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She heard him chuckle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not <em>see</em>—feel. I learned the trick in
the Florida swamps last summer. Osceola,
chief of the Seminoles, taught me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes! He’s a wonder in the woods.
How is it done?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell you sometime. Here we are—at
the Stone Hill River. You’ll have to get
your feet wetter, I’m afraid, but it’s only a
small stream, not deep. We turn right,
here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Golly, it’s cold!” Dorothy splashed into
the water behind him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Brrr—I know it. Lift your feet high
or you’ll fall over these boulders. And
please try to make as little noise as possible.”</p>

<p class='c008'>From the direction of the woodlot came
a prodigious crashing and threshing. The
pursuit had gained the woods.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Noise!” she said scornfully, floundering
along in his wake. “Those thugs can’t
hear me—they’re making too much racket
themselves. I suppose, Bill, you’re working
on a plan, but what it can be is a mystery
to me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You mean—where we’re bound for?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes. We can’t get back to the big pasture
and the hill up to Stoker’s house.
They’ll head off any play of that kind.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know that. Stand still a minute, I
want to listen.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But Bill—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sh—yes, that must be it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Must be what?” There was impatience
in Dorothy’s tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The waterfall I was trying to find.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You don’t mean to tell me you’re planning
to crawl behind a waterfall and hide!
Honestly, Bill, I—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, nothing like that,” he answered
coolly, “the fall isn’t big enough.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look here, will you <em>please</em>—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right, calm yourself. We haven’t
much time but I guess they’ve lost our trail
for the time being. On the way over here
in the car, Terry told me something of the
lay of the land. He’s crazy about hiking,
you know, and mountain climbing. He’s
walked all over the reservation and he
knows it like his own back yard.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, yes, what of it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, Terry told me that there is just
one possible way to get out of this Stony
Hill River Valley on this side. That is, unless
one goes a mile or two up or down the
valley. There are entrances to the reservation
at either end—dirt roads that cross
from the concrete turnpike over to this
ridge above us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But there is a way out?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes. A sort of trail up the cliffs. It’s
not marked on the map of the reservation.
Terry found it last summer. Pretty tough
going even in daylight, I guess.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But how on earth can we find it in the
dark?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Terry told me that a smaller stream
flowed into this creek at just about this
point, and that it drops into the river gully
by way of a low waterfall. It was the sound
of that fall I was listening for. Hear it just
over there to the right?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the next move?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We turn our backs on the waterfall, and
cross this stream. The trail starts in a kind
of open chimney in the foot of the cliffs.
The map calls these young precipices
Raven Rocks, by the way. If you think it is
too dangerous, we can let those chaps catch
us. They’ll probably let us go soon
enough. They’re trailing the wrong party,
though they haven’t realized it. What do
you say?” Bill’s tone was non-committal.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know, they took you for Stoker Conway.
But don’t you see, Bill—” her tone
was firm, “they must not find out their mistake.
While they’re tracking us, they will
leave the Conway house alone, and that’ll
give Terry and Stoker a chance to hunt for
the book and the letter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill’s reply was flippant, but there was
a note of relief in his voice. “Chance to
get a good night’s rest, you mean!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’re not going to bed—” Dorothy
pulled her companion toward the opposite
bank of the stream. “Terry told me so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank goodness we’re out of that,” she
exclaimed a moment later as they climbed
the steep side of the gully. “If there’s anything
colder than a trout stream, I’ve yet to
find it. I’m soaked nearly to my waist—how
about you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ditto. We’ll be warm enough presently—just
as soon as we hit Raven Rocks.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wish we had raven’s wings—we could
use ’em!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Listen!” Bill stopped suddenly in his
tracks.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t <em>say</em> that,” she whispered—“reminds
me of old man Lewis!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’re coming this way. I guess they
got tired of beating the woods for us. Take
my hand again. We’ve got to find that
chimney.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They went perhaps ten paces more when
Bill brought up short again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here’s the cliff—wait where you are—be
back in a minute.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He drew his fingers from her clasp and
she heard him move off. Standing in utter
darkness she could hear the men splashing
toward them along the shallow river
bed, and still others tramping through the
woods with flashing lights that moved
nearer every second.</p>

<p class='c008'>Not once did her alert mind question the
advisability of trying to scale Raven Rocks
on a coal-black night. Not once did she
waste a thought on the danger of that perilous
enterprise. Dorothy Dixon never
counted the cost when it was to help a
friend. Her entire attention was centered
on their pursuers. Who they were, or why
they sought George and his letter were
points of little consequence now. All that
mattered was that they be kept on their
search for as many hours as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>Presently they would come abreast and
their lights would pick her out at the foot of
the cliff. The sopping skirt of her frock
sagged about her knees, dank and clammy
beneath her slicker. She gathered it in her
hands and squeezed what water she could
from it, more for want of something to do
than for any other reason.</p>

<p class='c008'>No longer could she hear Bill stumbling
about. What could have happened to him?
The lights were only a dozen yards away
now. In another minute or two their glare
would pick her up for a certainty.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the first time that evening, Dorothy
became fidgety. Bill had told her to remain
here. That was an order, and must
be obeyed. But—oh! if Bill would only
come!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch08' class='c009'><i>Chapter VIII</i><br /> <br />THE CHIMNEY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Then on her right she heard a soft rustling,
immediately followed by a low call:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dorothy, where are you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The words brought her joyous relief.
“Coming!” she replied in a cautious whisper,
and with her left hand feeling the almost
sheer wall, she hurried toward Bill’s
voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the darkness he grasped her hand
and spoke close to her ear. “I’ve located
the chimney, Dorothy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good! I was getting worried. Is it
far away?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No. Only a few steps.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What kept you so long, Bill?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Had to find the rope.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What rope?”</p>

<p class='c008'>They were moving now in the direction
from which he had come.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The one Terry hid in a niche of the
rocks. Talk of hunting needles in a—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But do we need it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Couldn’t risk the climb without it.
You’ve never done any mountain scaling—I
have.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, what’s the dope?”</p>

<p class='c008'>They had stopped and Bill took her arm.
“Here—let me knot this end around your
waist. First, ditch the slicker, though.
You won’t be able to climb in that. I’ll
take care of it for the present.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He took her coat and she felt him make
the rope secure.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m tied to the other end,” he told her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But what’ll you do about my slicker,
Bill? If we ever get to the top of the
ridge, I’ll need it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill was busy and didn’t answer for a
moment. Then—“Your coat and mine
are rolled up and lashed to my back,” he
explained. “I’m going first. I know more
about this kind of thing than you, and my
reach is longer. May have to pull you up
the hard places. Don’t be afraid to put
weight on the rope when I give the word.
But if you slip—yell.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He did not say that a slip on her part
would in all probability pull him with her
to crash on the rocky ground below. Bill
Bolton did not believe in being an alarmist,
but she understood just the same.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thanks, I’ll do my best, Bill.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Start climbing.” His voice came from
above her head and she felt a jerk on the
rope. “This chimney is a fissure in the
cliff, and it slants slightly upward, thank
goodness. Reach above and get handholds
on the rock projections first. Then pull
yourself up, until you find a foothold.
When you put your weight on your feet,
press your legs against the side walls. That
will keep you from slipping. Take it easy
and rest as much as you like. This kind of
thing can only be done slowly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m coming,” Dorothy said quietly and
she pressed her body into the niche she
could not see.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s the stuff! I’ll rest while you
climb. And while you’re doing it, I’ll keep
the rope taut and out of your way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy was silent. Groping in the
darkness above her head, her fingers came
in contact with a rough projection. It was
little more than a small knob in the rocky
side of the chimney, but she managed to
get a firm grip on it with her right hand.
Her left found another projection slightly
lower on the other side. She exerted all her
strength and slithered upward.</p>

<p class='c008'>Drawing her knees up she sought rests
for her feet on the sides, but the rock
seemed absolutely smooth. For an instant
she was at a loss. Then remembering
Bill’s advice, she pressed her legs
against the chimney walls and pushed.</p>

<p class='c008'>That her body moved upward so easily
came as a surprise. It was hard to realize
that sheer walls would give such a purchase.
Almost at once her shoulders were
above the hand holds and she could raise
herself by pressing downward until her
left knee was planted on the same projection
that she had gripped with that hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>Braced firmly against the rock, she
looked for higher hand holds, found them
and soon was able to get her left foot on to
the place where her knee had been. With
her weight on that foot, it became a simple
matter to plant her right in the opposite
niche. Straightening her body, she lay
forward against the slanting cliff and
rested.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go ahead, Bill,” she called in a low
voice as soon as she could speak.</p>

<p class='c008'>“O.K., kid,” came the prompt reply
from overhead. “On my way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Pressed against the wet rockface she
could hear the scrape of his boots and the
heavy breathing of muscular strain. Her
own thin soled shoes were sodden from the
wet of the woods and pasture. Worse still,
the leather was bursting at the sides. And
this climb would probably complete their
ruin. By the time she reached the top, they
would be beyond walking in at all. Never
again would she board her plane shod in
pumps.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come along!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill interrupted her soliloquy, and using
the same tactics as before she continued
to climb.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first drops of rain she had felt at the
bottom of the cliff now increased to a steady
downpour. Dorothy became soaked to
the skin. Water from her leather helmet
ran down her forehead, forcing her to keep
her eyes closed most of the time.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cliff, wet and slippery from the preceding
storm, was soon slick as a greased
slide. Twice she lost her foothold and
would have fallen had not her sharp cry
warned Bill in time. How he managed to
stick to his precarious perch and bear her
weight on the rope until she found a grip
on the rock again was more than she could
fathom. Each time she slipped her heart
almost stopped beating. And the horrible
emptiness at the pit of her stomach made
her feel deathly ill. But she never wholly
lost her nerve. Climbing, then resting, she
kept steadily on.</p>

<p class='c008'>But her strenuous exertions and the almost
continuous strain on muscles ordinarily
little used was wearing down her vitality.
Would this terrible climbing in the
dark never end, she thought. Her whole
body ached, her arms and legs felt heavy as
lead. Wearily she raised her right hand
seeking another hold. When she felt Bill’s
fingers grasp her own, she started. The
shock very nearly caused her to lose balance.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now your other paw,” said his well-known
voice somewhere above in the
gloom. “That’s the way—up you come.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then before she really understood what
was happening, Dorothy was dragged
higher until she was seated beside Bill on
a narrow ledge. His right arm held her
tightly. He was puffing like a grampus.</p>

<p class='c008'>She wriggled and wiped the water and
perspiration from her eyes with a wet,
clammy hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sit tight—old girl,” Bill’s words came
in little jerks. “I know you’re used to altitudes
in a plane, but this is different. I
guess you’ll get a shock when you look below,
so—steady.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy opened her eyes and was glad
of his supporting arm. Far below, at the
foot of the cliff, pinpoints of light moved
hither and yon, puncturing the darkness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They know we’re somewhere up here,”
he said softly. “Heard you when you
slipped, I dare say. Well, we’ll take some
finding—and that’s no lie,” he chuckled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why—I—I—had no idea we’d come so
far,” she stammered. “Those lights look
miles away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Three or four hundred feet, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Funny—it makes me almost dizzy to
look down there. You’re right—it is different
from flying altitude. Bill, do you
think they’ll find the chimney?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe. But they’re not likely to try
to use it—not tonight, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why not? We did it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We were sure of a way up—they aren’t.
And I don’t imagine they bargained for
any blind climb up cliffs like these in the
rain and darkness. They wouldn’t mind
slugging one of us with a sand bag, but
when it comes to real danger, they’d count
themselves out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gee,” Dorothy giggled nervously. “I
wish I’d been able to!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Count yourself out? Well, I don’t
blame you, kid. Nerve-wracking isn’t the
name for it. But you certainly stood up
well. Do you feel able to go on now?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I suppose so.” Her reply was
rather weak.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then we’d better get under way. Terry
said the chimney was the worst of it and
we are through with that now. It ends at
this ledge.” He helped her to her feet.
“Brrr—that wind is cold on wet clothes.
If we don’t get moving, we’ll cop a dose of
pneumonia, sure as shooting!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re a nice, thoughtful fella, Bill,”
Dorothy smiled grimly in his direction.
“Trouble is your thoughtfulness is oddly
strenuous at times. Is there much farther
to go?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re more than half way,” he assured
her, “and from now on you’ll get more
walking than climbing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy wanted to laugh but was too
tired to do so.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lead on, MacDuffer,” she cried
gamely. “I’m lame, halt and blind, but I’ll
do my best to follow my chief!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Atta girl,” he commended. “Give us
your paw again, we can travel better that
way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll travel, all right—that is, unless
our friend Terry is a dyed-in-the-wool fabricator.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hopefully not, as they say in the
Fatherland,” he chuckled. He caught her
hand in his and they started on a climb up
the steep hill that ran back from the ledge.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Bill had predicted, the going here
was not nearly so difficult as it had been
in the chimney. So far as Dorothy could
tell, the cliffs, which were covered with a
grass-grown rubble, sloped in at this point,
and at a much easier angle of ascent.
Whereas the chimney was almost perpendicular,
here, by bending forward and aiding
progress with occasional handholds
on bushes and rocky outcroppings, it was
possible to do more than merely creep forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>A slip, of course, would be dangerous.
It would be hard to stop rolling, once
started down the incline; and unless a bush
or a boulder were conveniently in the way,
a bound over the ledge would be inevitable—and
then oblivion.</p>

<p class='c008'>She did not like to think about it. Bill
guided her up the incline and did so with
uncanny accuracy, considering the darkness,
and the fact that he had not travelled
this trail before. She came to the conclusion
that the worst was over, when he
stopped abruptly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sit down and take it easy,” he advised.
“This is where I’ve got to see what we’re
doing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Surely you’re not going to show a
light?” she asked in alarm, and sank down
on the rocky ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have to,” was his quick reply. “Those
guys below us know we’re up here, so what
does it matter?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I thought we were almost at the
top.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Almost, but not quite. Look at that!”</p>

<p class='c008'>A beam of light shot upward from his
torch, and turning her head, she saw a
sight that sent her heart down to the very
tips of her ragged, soaking pumps.</p>

<p class='c008'>They had indeed come to the top; but
merely to the top of this steep hillside of
bushes and rubble. Where this ended, a
few feet away, the naked rock towered almost
perpendicular. Forty feet or more
from its base this wall jutted sharply outward,
half that distance again.</p>

<p class='c008'>She sprang to her feet, an exclamation
of dismay on her lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>This rock canopy above their heads, this
absolutely unscalable barrier to their hopes
extended in both directions so far as the eye
could see.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill, who had moved several feet downhill,
was flashing his light back and forth
along the rugged edge of this roof of rock
beneath which she stood.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How far does it go?” she asked in a
small voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“According to Terry,” he replied, “right
to where the cliffs end—both ways—and
without a break or a tunnel. But you can’t
walk along underneath very far, because
this slant we are on is only forty or fifty
yards wide. Beyond it in either direction
there’s a sheer drop.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then—we’re out of luck.” Her tone
was entirely hopeless.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill laughed shortly. “Where Terry got
down, we can get up—but it’s not going to
be easy—and that’s sure fire!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch09' class='c009'><i>Chapter IX</i><br /> <br />OVER THE TOP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Well! If you know the way out, why
don’t you say so?” Dorothy flared in exasperation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What?” returned Bill vaguely.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was walking across the side of the
hill, keeping beneath the end of the rocky
overhang forty feet above his head. The
light from his electric torch swept along
the edge of this seemingly unsurmountable
obstruction. Then it darted out and upward
as if to pierce the dripping night
above.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you speak?” he amended, looking
back at her. “Thought I heard you say
something, but couldn’t quite catch it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His voice was as sincere as the words
he had just uttered, but Dorothy’s reply
was caustic.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I said why keep the secret to yourself?
All this stuff about how Terry got down
and we are supposed to get up is keeping
me on pins and needles. If Terry left a
rope ladder or something hanging over the
edge last summer, it must be gone by now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, he didn’t use a rope ladder—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, it looks to me as if we’d have to
fly up if we ever want to get to the top of
this ridge! I don’t know whether you’re
<em>trying</em> to tantalize me—but you’re succeeding,
all right. For goodness’ sake, Bill, if
you know the answer, tell me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m sorry, Dorothy,” he called repentantly.
He ran up the incline toward her.
“I didn’t mean to leave you in the soup—I
ought to have realized—Look, I’m awfully
sorry,” he repeated in sincere contrition.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, that’s all right, Bill.” She was embarrassed
now. “I had no business to get
so shirty.” Under the light of the torch,
their eyes met in a smile of friendly understanding.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But please tell me what it is you’re trying
to find?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, the tree—I honestly thought I’d
told you about it before.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What tree?” she asked patiently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The one that Terry used to get down
here. It’s our only hope.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I don’t see any tree. If there is one,
how is it going to help us?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill took her hand and gave it a little pat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come over here with me,” he said, and
led the way toward the spot where he had
been standing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But Bill—there’s no tree up there—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wait until I get the light on it. There
you are!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And there was a tree, after all. But instead
of pointing toward the heavens like
any other tree she had ever seen, this Colorado
spruce grew sideways out from the
top of the cliff. With the exception of a
few tufts on the top, its branches grew only
on the upper side of the horizontal trunk,
giving it more the appearance of a ragged
hedge than an honest-to-goodness tree.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I get you,” she said slowly. “The tree—and
the rope.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Aha! young lady, you’re not so dumb
as you’d sometimes like people to think!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But is the rope long enough?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hope so. Terry claimed he used it
double.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes?” she said doubtfully. “But will
the tree hold us both? You’ve been a sailor,
but I don’t think I’m up to climbing a
swinging rope, hand over hand after coming
up that chimney.” She thought for
a moment, then went on. “There’s only
one way I can get up there. You’ll have to
tie one end of the rope to a stone and sling
it over the trunk. When that end drops,
we can take out the stone, I’ll stick my
foot in the loop and—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bill Bolton pulls you up,” he ended for
her. “That listens well, Dorothy, and if
the rope was running through a pulley up
there, everything would be hunky-dory.
As it is, she’ll be chafing against a hard,
uneven surface. I’d probably pull the tree
down, even if I was able to get you off the
ground.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But my arms feel dead—right up to my
shoulders.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know, kid. But you can do it, after
I fix the rope and you have lashed your
end to this big bush here. It’s going to be
a case of shin for you, not hand over hand
climb. Although that’s not so hard when
you know how. Like most things, there’s
a knack to it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right. I’ll do my best.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ll make it,” he assured her. “If
you’ll untie that end of the rope from
around your waist, I’ll hunt up a rock and
we’ll get busy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Presently a heavy stone was fastened to
the rope end.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stand clear,” sang out Bill. Then as
she stepped back, he swung the stone round
and round in a vertical circle, much as a
seaman heaves the lead for a sounding.</p>

<p class='c008'>Up went the stone and the rope, and
Dorothy watched with bated breath while
she pointed the torch for guidance. She
saw it swing over the tree trunk and drop
to earth on the farther side.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Snappy work, Bill,” she applauded.
“Who goes first? You or me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is a case where gentlemen take
precedence. I’ll go first—and show you a
little trick they teach midshipmen at
Annapolis.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He untied the knot which held the stone
and bringing the ends together pulled the
rope until the lengths on both sides of the
trunk were even.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So long,” he breezed, “see you anon!”</p>

<p class='c008'>With a hand on either rope he swung
himself upward, seemingly without effort.
It was as though he were lifting a penny-weight
rather than one hundred and
seventy-five pounds of solid American
bone and muscle. Then with a quick
movement he twisted the slack ends about
his thighs, and the girl was amazed to see
him let go both hands and wave.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s a way we have in the Navy,” he
laughed. “Quite a comfortable seat—if
you know how. Skirts are rather in the
way, so I don’t advise you to try it. Although
I must say in parting that you have
already parted with the greater part of your
skirt.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy giggled. “What of it? There’s
a perfectly good pair of bloomers underneath.”
She was amused by his fooling,
though she suspected he was trying to put
heart into her.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill coughed. “Finicky persons of British
extraction might claim that your last
statement was a decided bloomer itself—but
I digress—” he went on, in the manner
of a barker at a side show. “Laydees and
gen-tel-men—I wish to state that William
Bolton, late tiddledywinks champion of the
Nutmeg State, is about to give his famous
impersonation of a monkey on a stick!”</p>

<p class='c008'>His hands grasped the ropes above his
head. Up came his body, the turns about
his thighs providing an apparently comfortable
seat or purchase, while his hands
shot upward again. The speed with which
he went through these movements was remarkable,
the swiftness of his passage up
the ropes only comparable to an East Indian
running up a cocoanut palm. Before
Dorothy could believe her eyes, he was sitting
astride the tree trunk, hauling up the
rope.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That was marvelous!” she called up to
him. “Some day you’ll have to show me
how you do it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“O.K.!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She saw now that one end of the rope
was coming slowly down again. As it sank
nearer, her torch brought to view the fact
that it was knotted every few feet. Soon
she was able to catch the swinging end.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Make it fast to that bush,” he commanded.</p>

<p class='c008'>She did as she was told and turned to
him for further orders.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill pulled the rope taut, then lashed his
end about the trunk close to the point where
the tree jutted out from the rock. That
done he slashed the loose half free with his
knife just above the knot.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That gives us a hauling line,” she heard
him say. “I’ll hang on to this end—you
knot the other about your waist.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She caught the end that he threw down
and after fastening it securely about her,
peered up at him again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right for me to shin up?” she asked,
with a hand on the knotted rope that was
to act as her ladder to the dizzy height
above.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wait till I get back on terra firma—this
tree won’t stand our combined weights.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Perhaps a minute elapsed. Then she
heard his voice again, though she could no
longer see him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come ahead!” he directed. “Sing out
when you start and let me know if I pull
too hard.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy switched off the light and
slipped the torch down the back of her
frock where it was caught in the blouse
made by the line about her waist.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ready!” she called and grasping the
taut rope, she started to shin up.</p>

<p class='c008'>Almost immediately she was helped on
her way by a steady pull on the line Bill
was holding. The going was difficult but
the knots held her and kept her from slipping.
Notwithstanding aching arm and
leg muscles, it was surprising how easily
she was able to hoist herself upward with
the added pull from above. The actual distance
to be climbed was not so great, but it
seemed unbelievably soon when her hands
touched the tree trunk.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill called a warning. “Get a good purchase
around the rope with your legs, then
lift your arms—take hold of the branches
on top of the trunk and heave!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She felt a stronger pull on the rope; her
hands grasped two upright branches and
she was dragged upward and on to the tree.
Bill caught her under her arms and swung
her on to the rock. Then he picked her
up bodily and carried her back a few yards
from the edge of the chasm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hurray! We’re up!” he gasped and
let her down on solid ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy did not reply. For a moment
speech was beyond her. She sank down
on a boulder. After a little while she untied
the rope that belted her and producing
the electric torch, handed it to Bill.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Snap on the light, will you?—while I
take stock of the damage. I know I’m a
wreck, but it’s just as well to learn the worst
at once.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Rather rumpled,” he pronounced as he
complied with her request. “Good night!
You’ve only got one shoe!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lost the other coming up the rope.
This one is no good either. What’s left of
it is just a mass of soaking pulp.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then she laughed softly as she brushed
some spruce needles from her knees and
picked a malicious little bit of flint from
the palm of one hand. Her wet skirt was
in ribbons. She saw that her stockings
were a mass of ladders now, and she had
a suspicion that her knickers were torn.
But what did such trifles matter when one
was bent upon a great achievement?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pretty bad,” she admitted and stood up
on one foot. “Hand me my slicker, please.
This rig is beyond repair—that will keep
some of the wind out. Gee, it’s chilly!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And wet,” he added grimly, as he
helped her into the coat. “Sorry to have
to remind you, Dorothy, but we’ve got to
be on our way, again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t think I can go any further, Bill.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He knew this to be a candid statement of
fact, not a complaint.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But we must, Dorothy. They are coming
after us, you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not up this cliff! Unless, you mean—”
her voice was troubled, “the rope! Could
you slide down ours and untie that from
the bushes, then shin up again?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I could, but it isn’t necessary. They
aren’t coming that way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is there another way?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, for them. By the road across the
valley and around by either of the entrances
to the reservation.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why are you so sure?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because while I was out on the tree
trunk, I saw lights going up the hill. Then
a car which evidently had been parked
down the road from Stoker’s house, started
off toward the Boutonville entrance.
Which means, of course, that they’ll motor
in on the Boutonville road. That crosses
the reservation. Then all they’ve got to
do is to leave the car at the mouth of the
Fire Tower trail and hike down here along
the top of the cliffs. They’ve cut off any
retreat down the cliffs on our part, too.
Those birds intend to catch us—or rather,
they want to get hold of Stoker pretty badly.
They’ve left men down in the valley, I saw
their lights.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, it will take them some time to
walk over here from the Boutonville road,”
Dorothy said wearily. “I’m going to sleep.
I’ve got to.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can’t—not in this rain. And
you’re soaked through into the bargain.”
Bill’s tone was firm. “Wait a minute—I’ve
got an idea.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy, who was half dozing with her
back to the boulder, opened her eyes with
an effort. She saw him draw forth a paper
from his pocket, unfold it and study it with
the aid of the lighted torch.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is a map of Poundridge Reservation,”
he explained. “Here’s a trail that
leads back from Raven Rocks to the Spy
Rock Trail. This end of it must be about
a hundred yards along the cliffs to our left,
if I’ve got my bearings right. Listen,
Dorothy! These two trails meet about a
mile and a half from here—and close by is
a cabin. It’s marked Shelter No. 6 on the
map. Once in there we’ll be under cover.
These shelters are rented to campers during
the summer, you know. There’s sure
to be a fireplace. I’ll find the dry wood and
we can dry out and get warm.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy yawned and shut her eyes
again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No use, Bill. I hate to be a short
sport—but I’m just all in. Chances are
we’d find the cabin locked when we got
there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill put the map back in his pocket.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t blame you,” was what he said.
“I’m used to roughing it and I don’t feel
any too scrumptious myself. But we’ve
got to do something. The gang will be
here in less than an hour. But I must admit
that I don’t see how you’re going to
walk a mile and a half with only one shoe.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked down at Dorothy. She was
fast asleep.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch10' class='c009'><i>Chapter X</i><br /> <br />OL’ MAN RIVER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Poor kid! She certainly is all in,” Bill
muttered in a tone that was close to despair.
What on earth was he going to do
now?</p>

<p class='c008'>The wind had stiffened and heavy rain
slanted out of the east in an unremitting
deluge. Both of them were soaked to the
skin under their slickers. Despite his vigorous
cliff-climbing, Bill was chilled to
that Dorothy, huddled against the boulder,
was shivering in her sleep.</p>

<p class='c008'>He himself was weary and heavy-eyed.
His vitality was at low ebb. But with a
sudden exertion of latent will power he
got painfully to his feet. He bent over the
sleeping girl and taking her by the shoulders
shook her back and forth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wake up, Dorothy!” he called. “Wake
up!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Deep in oblivion, she made no answer.
Bill shook her harder.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Leave me ’lone,” she murmured drowsily.
“Want sleep—go ’way!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Putting forth his full strength, Bill
lifted her until she stood leaning against
him still sound asleep. Bringing her arms
up and over his shoulders, he pivoted in a
half circle. Now that his back was toward
her, he bent forward, and catching
her legs, drew them over his thighs.
Dorothy, still oblivious to all that went on,
was hoisted up into the position called by
small children, “riding piggy-back.”
Though slender, she was well-built and
muscular, and he was surprised at her dead
weight. With his forearms beneath her
knees, clutching the lighted torch with one
hand, he moved slowly off with her in the
direction of the Raven Rock Trail.</p>

<p class='c008'>After some little trouble he found it, a
narrow swath cutting back through the
forest at right angles to the top of the cliffs.
Without hesitation he began to follow the
path.</p>

<p class='c008'>Overhead the twisted branches met in
a natural arch. It seemed even darker below
their dripping foliage than in the open
on the cliffs, and the feeble ray from his
flash light penetrated but a few feet into
the yawning black ahead. It was heavy
going with Dorothy’s solid weight on his
back. The uneven ground, sodden with
rain, was slippery where his feet did not
sink in the muddy loam. And at times he
was near to falling with his burden.</p>

<p class='c008'>The trail followed a snakelike course.
For a time it wound over comparatively
level ground, then dipped steeply into a
hollow. The girl was becoming heavier
by the minute. Bill stuck it out until they
topped the opposite rise, then let her down.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy awoke with a start.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are you doing?” she cried.
“Where am I?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So far as I can make out, we’re about
half a mile down the Raven Rock trail,”
he said slowly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And—and you carried me all this
way?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Piggyback,” he replied laconically.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, Bill! You must be nearly dead—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, there have been times when I’ve
felt more peppy—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How could you, Bill? Why didn’t you
wake me up?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tried to—but it just wasn’t any use.
You couldn’t have walked it, anyway—with
only one shoe.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes, I could. But you were sweet
to do it, only—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Better climb aboard again,” he suggested,
ignoring her praise, “we’ve got all
of a mile to go before we get to the cabin.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy made a gesture of dissent.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thanks, old dear. I’m going to walk.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, if you feel up to it—you take my
shoes—I’ll get along fine without them in
this mud.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll do nothing of the kind. I’ve got a
better plan. Stupid of me not to think of
it before. Hand over your knife, please.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy cut two long strips, six or seven
inches wide, from the bottom of her slicker.
“I’m going to use these to bind up my feet,”
she explained and handed back the knife.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wait a minute!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill seized his own raincoat and cut two
wider strips, which he folded into pads.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sit down on that stump, and hold up
your hoof,” he ordered. “I’ll show you
how it’s done.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy hopped to the stump and after
seating herself, kicked off her remaining
shoe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There goes the end of a perfect pump,”
she chuckled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Think I’ll keep it for luck,” declared
Bill.</p>

<p class='c008'>She raised her eyebrows and laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Some girls might think you were becoming
sentimental—you, of all people!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I know it’s only because you were
born practical. You want that shoe so as
to prevent anyone else from finding it, the
men who are chasing us, for instance?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I never argue with members of the opposite
sex—that’s why I still enjoy good
health.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He grinned and pocketed the shoe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hold up your foot, young lady. It’s
a lovely night and all that, but we’re going
to get out of it as soon as possible.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He placed one of the folded pads beneath
the sole of her foot and wound a strip
of slicker about it and the foot bringing
the ends together in a knot about her ankle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now the other,” he prompted, and
dealt with it in the same way.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy stood up and took a trial step
or two.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wonderful!” she said. “I could walk
to New York in these. They’re a lot more
comfortable than the shoes I ordinarily
wear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll have to patent the idea.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That reminds me, Bill,” Dorothy spoke
slowly. They were moving along the trail
again. “Do you think the letter Mr. Conway
is supposed to have written Stoker
could possibly have had anything to do
with patents?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What patents?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I don’t know exactly—patents belonging
to Mr. Conway.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You mean—which he left to Stoker?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, yes. Mr. Conway was an inventor.
He must have patented things.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very probably. But Stoker told us that
his father’s entire estate amounted to the
place he’s living in and a few thousand
dollars. If Mr. Conway still owned patent
rights on his inventions, why weren’t
they mentioned in the will?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You think, then, that he sold them before
his death?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Looks that way,” summed up Bill.
“Anyway, if there were patents, they’d be
registered in Washington. It wouldn’t do
anyone any good to steal them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy tramped along beside him. Except
for the sound of their footsteps squishing
in the muddy path and the drip of the
rain from wet leaves and branches, the
woods were very still.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What can those people be after if it
isn’t the patents on Mr. Conway’s inventions?”
she said in a puzzled tone, after a
pause.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Search me—what ever it is, the thing
must be very valuable. They’d never take
all this trouble otherwise.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Give us all this trouble, you mean. And
here’s another riddle, Bill. Why was Hilltop
sold?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill threw her a glance and shrugged.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ask me something real hard,” he suggested,
“You’re the Sherlock Holmes of
this case. I’m only a mighty dumb Doctor
Watson. And I’m no good at problems
in deduction, even when my thinkbox is
moting properly—which it isn’t at present.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But there must have been some good
reason for the sale of that property,” she
persisted. “When Stoker went back to
Lawrenceville after the Easter holidays
last spring, everything at home was going
on just as usual—a big place, servants,
cars, horses, plenty of money—everything.
Then he came back from school in June,
and all that everything just wasn’t!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And father had moved into that dump
on the Stone Hill River road with a part-time
maid-of-all-work, and that 1492 flivver....
Deucedly clear and all that! By
the way, do they teach English or just plain
Connecticut Yankee at the New Canaan
High? Your use of words at times is more
forceful than grammatic.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Grammatical for choice. You’re not
so hot on the oratory yourself, Bill. People
who live in glass houses, you know—?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wish we were in one,” was his reply.
“Anything with a fire and a roof that sheds
water would suit me just now!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are you trying to do, Bill, evade
my question?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy’s nap had done her good.
Though still weary and stiff, she felt tantalizingly
argumentative for all that she was
wringing wet and horribly chilly. Talking
helped to keep up her spirits. Just
ahead their torch revealed a branching of
the path.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The map says we keep to the right,” announced
Bill. “It’s only a step over to the
Spy Rock trail now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Glad to hear it—but it seems to me you
<em>are</em> trying to evade my questions!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Questions?” He chuckled. “They
come too fast and furious. And to be honest,
how can you expect me to guess the
right answers when you don’t know them
yourself? You certainly are the one and
only human interrogation point tonight.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And you’re so helpful,” she retorted.
“This is the most mysterious affair I’ve
ever been mixed up in.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here we are at the other trail, praise
be to Allah.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Turn to the right?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s it. In about a hundred yards
we ought to run on to a path leading off to
the left. That leads to shelter No. 6. The
cabin’s quite near now, if this map in my
pocket’s any good.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They trudged along the trail and a
couple of minutes later in the dim glow
from the flash they saw an opening in the
trees.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on,” he said, quickening his
pace. “We’ll be under cover in a jiffy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll probably have to break in.”
Dorothy caught up with him as the path
swung round in a quarter circle to the left.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, we won’t,” he replied, catching her
arm and coming to a halt. At the same
time he shut off the electric torch.</p>

<p class='c008'>Straight ahead in the darkness they could
make out the blur of a small building.
Through a chink in what they took to
be a closed shutter came a thin ray of
light.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Somebody’s got there ahead of us,” Bill
observed more to himself than to Dorothy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are we going to do?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do? What can we do but knock them
up and ask for shelter?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess you’re right,” she admitted.
“Neither of us can go on until we’ve had
rest and a drying out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s how I look at it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ve got to go easy, though. Remember
what I trotted into with Betty at
Stoker’s house?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where do you get this ‘we’ stuff?” he
said rather gruffly. “Here, take this gun
and get behind a tree. I’m going over
there. If they get nasty when they open
up, I’ll sidestep—and you can use your
own judgment.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll use it right now, Bill. I’m going
to the house with you. Don’t argue—”
She started on along the path.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill caught up with her. “Take the automatic,
anyway,” he shoved the gun into
her hand. “Shoot through your pocket
if you have to. Better keep it out of sight.
Stand to one side just out of the line of
light when they open. All set?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go ahead.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy’s right hand gripped the revolver
in her pocket. She slipped off the
safety catch, pointed her forefinger along
the snubnosed barrel and let her middle
finger rest lightly on the trigger.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rat-tat-tat—rat-tat-tat. Bill’s fist
pounded the cabin door. There came a
pause. She felt the quickened beats of her
heart. Rain pounding on the gutterless
roof dripped in a steady trickle on her bare
head and down her neck. From somewhere
nearby came the mournful cry of a
hoot owl.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill knocked again. Within the little
house they heard the sound of footsteps.
Dorothy stiffened.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bolts of the door were withdrawn,
the door opened and Dorothy stepped up
beside Bill. Framed in the lighted rectangle
was an ancient, white haired negro.
He peered out at them from beneath the
cotton-tufts of his eyebrows, blinded for the
moment by the night.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good evening, Uncle. Can we come
in out of the wet for a little while?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill’s tone held the gentle camaraderie of
those brought up by darky servants in the
South.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lordy, Lordy—white folks, an’ drippin’
wet!” exclaimed the old fellow,
straightening his bent back and smiling
pleasantly. “Walk right in, Capt’in—and
you, too, Missy. Ol’ Man River ain’t got
quarters like you is prob’ly useter—But it’s
dry and it’s warm, an’ yo-all’s sho’ is welcome!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch11' class='c009'><i>Chapter XI</i><br /> <br />MR. JOHN J. JOYCE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you, Uncle,” said Bill and motioning
Dorothy to go first, he stepped
across the threshold.</p>

<p class='c008'>The old darky slammed the door shut
behind them blotting out the storm, and
sent the bolt home.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yo’all go over ter the fire an’ drip,” he
beamed, pointing to the blazing logs in the
fireplace of native stone. “Lordy, Lordy,
you chillen is sho’ ’nuf half drown’. But
we’s gwine ter fix dat sho’ nuf in a jiffy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>While the two warmed their hands at
the hearth, he bustled off towards the rear
of the cabin and disappeared through a
doorway that led into another room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy looked at Bill and smiled delightedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cabin was primitive though there
was a cozy and homelike air about it. The
chinks between the bark of the logs which
formed the walls were stuffed with dry moss
and clay. There was no ceiling to the
room. One looked up through the cross
beams clear to the gable of the slanting
roof. From these sturdy four-by-fours
hung half a ham, several bunches of onions,
a pair of rubber boots and other oddments.
Wide boards had been laid across
them in a couple of places, evidently to
provide holdalls for other paraphernalia.</p>

<p class='c008'>The small room’s principal article of
furniture was a rustic, handmade table.
Three stools without backs and an armchair
of like manufacture completed the
furnishings if one did not count several
shining pots and pans that hung on nails
driven into the logs and a huge pile of
kindling that took up an entire corner. A
steaming kettle hung from a crane over
the fire and the floor of the room flaunted
a large mat woven of brightly colored
grasses.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He keeps everything as neat as a new
pin,” Dorothy whispered. “Isn’t he perfectly
sweet?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wonder how he happens to be here,”
said Bill. “This shelter is state property.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shush—he’s coming.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The old darky ambled into the room
again, grinning from ear to ear. Ol’ Man
River, as he called himself, quite evidently
enjoyed bestowing hospitality. Over one
arm he carried a bundle of clothes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ise mighty thankful dat yo’all come
’long dis evenin’,” he exclaimed. “It sho’
do get mighty lonesome up in dese hyar
woods—speshally on a black night when
de rain come an’ de wind howl roun’ dis
cabin. I brought you all some clo’s.
’Twant much I could find, jes’ overalls and
shirts, like what Ise got on. But dey is
dry and dey is as clean an’ sweet as soap
and rainwater can make ’em.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy took the faded blue flannel
shirt and overalls he held out to her.
“Thank you, Uncle. You certainly are
kind and thoughtful, but it’s a shame to
use your clean clothes this way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The old man’s grin grew wider, his
even white teeth gleamed in the wrinkled
black of his kindly face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’ you menshun it, Missy. Dese
clo’s ain’t nuffin. Dey ain’t no tellin’
what’s gwine ter happen ef you don’ hop
inter de back room an’ take off yo’ wet
things. While yo’ gone, de young genneman
can change. An’ Ol’ Man River, he’s
gwine ter dish up supper. Now, Missy,
run away or yo’ll sho’ catch yo’ death in
dose wet things.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy hurried into the back room and
closed the door. On a little table she saw
an old fashioned oil lamp with a glass base
and an unshaded chimney, which cast a
cheerful glow of light over a home-made
bed which filled one side of the cubicle.
As she sat down, she found that instead of
a mattress, the bed boasted fir and hemlock
boughs, scented and springy to the touch.
Several khaki-colored army blankets were
neatly rolled at the foot of the bed. A row
of hooks behind the door and rudely fashioned
shelves which extended the breadth
of the partition between the two rooms,
completed the appointments of Ol’ Man
River’s bedroom.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy saw that the partition did not
rise clear to the peak of the roof, but ended
at the crossbeams. The sound of Bill’s
voice and the old darky’s came over the
top, and a most appetizing odor of coffee
and frying ham. It was just then that
Dorothy realized how famished she was.
A glance at her wristwatch showed that
it was a quarter past midnight.</p>

<p class='c008'>She continued to strip off her wet clothes
and the wrappings from her feet. Picking
up a couple of flour sacks from the stool
by the shuttered window, she gave herself
a thorough rub down. The home-made
towels had been washed until they were
soft as linen, and they sent a pleasant glow
of returning circulation throughout her
tired body. Warm and dry once more, she
donned the overalls and shirt and drew on
a heavy pair of gray wool socks. Though
the overalls needed turning up and the
shirt was too long in the sleeves and more
than a trifle wide across her shoulders, it
was on the whole a warm and comfortable
outfit.</p>

<p class='c008'>She rubbed her short, curly hair dry,
then combed it into place before the
cracked mirror which stood on the wall
shelf. A deft application of powder and
rouge from her ever-present compact completed
her simple toilet. There came a
knock on the door and Bill’s voice told her
that supper was ready.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Coming!” she called.</p>

<p class='c008'>Picking up the sodden heap of clothes
from the floor, she blew out the light,
opened the door and marched into the
other room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Transformation!” Bill saluted her
gaily. “How about it, Uncle Abe? You’d
never take her for the same person, would
you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The old man, who was bending over the
hearth, turned his head toward her and
smiled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Roses,” he said, “roses in June!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy laughed outright. “Thanks
for the compliment, Uncle Abe, but I’m
afraid these roses came out of a compact.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She hung her wet clothes over a chair,
near to Bill’s.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Den I should’a said, fresh as a rose,”
the old darky chuckled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And not half as dewey as when you let
us in,” added Bill. “By the way, Dorothy,
let me introduce our host, Uncle Abe Lincoln
River—known to the world at large
as Ol’ Man River, but to his friends he’s
Uncle Abe. And the young lady who is
parading around in your clothes, Uncle,
is Miss Dorothy Dixon of New Canaan,
known to many people as I-will-not-be-called-Dot!
She looks kind and gentle, but
if you value your life, never take her on
in a wrestling bout. She’s Sandow, the Terrible
Greek and the Emperor of Japan
all in one.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy waved him aside.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Get out of my way, slanderer!” she
cried. “I want to shake hands with Uncle
Abe. Dry clothes seem to have gone to
his head, Uncle.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The aged negro stood up and took her
outstretched hand between his horny
palms.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, I’se read about yo’all when I
worked fo’ Misteh Joyce, Missy. Dey
uster let me hab de papers after de folks
up dar ter de big house done finished wid
’em. Airplanes, robbers, ebbryt’ing!” Ol’
Man River shook his head. “Sho’ wuz tuk
back some ter see what ladies kin do dese
days, ma’am!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, then you must have read about
Mr. Bolton, here, too? Bill Bolton, the
flyer—?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dat’s so, ma’am. I done heard tell o’
dis genneman, too!” He turned his rolling
eyes in unfeigned admiration upon Bill.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill glared at Dorothy. “Oho! so you
put the spotlight on me, do you?” He cried
in pretended anger.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Ol’ Man River motioned toward the
table which was set with tin cups and
plates and a very much battered metal coffee pot.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Supper’s ready, Missy. I’se sorry I
ain’t got a cloth. ’P’raps yo’all won’t mind
dis time. Now if yo’ an’ Marse’ Bill will
tak’ yo’ chairs, I’ll serve it up quicker dan
whistlin’.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you’ve only set two places,” protested
Dorothy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Abe wagged his woolly pate. “It
ain’t right fo’ an’ ol’ niggeh ter sit down
wid de quality, Missy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stuff and nonsense! Put another cup
and plate on the table, Bill, and another
knife, fork and spoon. Uncle Abe’s going
to eat with us, or I won’t touch a thing—and
believe me, this food looks tempting!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, if yo’ puts it thataway, ma’am,
I will take a bite.” Uncle Abe gave a mellow
chuckle. “I sho’ duz love ham. De
smell of it in de pan fair do make my mouf
water!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy took up the hot skillet from
the hearth. “I’ll put the ham on the plates,
Uncle Abe, if you’ll bring over that pan
of hot bread you’ve got warming in the
ashes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not hot bread, Dorothy,” corrected
Bill, “—corn pone—real honest-to-goodness
corn pone!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mmmm—” she exclaimed with eyes
dancing, “hurry up, Uncle Abe, I just
can’t wait!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dey ain’t no butter,” explained Uncle
Abe, “but if yo’all puts some o’ dis ham
gravy over it, I reckon yo’ll fin’ yo’ kin
eat it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ho, that’s the best way to eat it!” cried
Bill. “Used to have it that way when I
lived at Annapolis. If there’s anything
that tastes better, I’ve yet to find it. And
look, Dorothy, we’ve got molasses to
sweeten our coffee! Uncle Abe sure does
set a real southern table.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The old man chuckled happily as they
sat down to the meal.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Marse Johnson done give me dat ’lasses,”
he said as he filled the coffee cups
from the battered pot. “He de big boss
o’ de reservation. I don’t mind tellin’ yo’all,
ma’am, if Marse Johnson didn’t wink
at Ol’ Man River a-livin’ in dis hyar cabin,
dis niggeh sho’ would be in a bad way.
But dese reservation folks is no white trash.
Dey knowed ’bout Marse Joyce turnin’ me
loose after I’d worked fo’ him all dese years.
I did odd jobs for ’em dis summer, an’ a
while back, Marse Johnson, he ’lowed I
could have de cabin, now it’s gettin’ kinda
chilly fo’ de ol’ man to sleep in de barn.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That was pretty decent of him,” remarked
Bill, with his mouth full of fried
ham and hot corn pone. “But who is this
Mr. Joyce you speak of, Uncle?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ol’ Man River wiped his mouth with the
back of his hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dat man’s name ez John J. Joyce,
Marse Billy. He’s got dat big place on de
ridge over yonder nexter Hilltop, Marse
Conway’s ol’ home. I worked fo’ Marse
Joyce fo’ ’bout ten years—eveh sence I
come up no’th from Virginny where dis
ol’ niggeh was raised.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And he let you go after you’d worked
for him all that time?” cried Dorothy, setting
down her coffee cup. “I call that
rotten mean!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaas, ma’am—John J. Joyce is sho’ a
hard man. I wuz one o’ de gard’ners on
de’ ’state. One noon he calls us all up ter
de big house. ‘Men,’ he say, standin’ on de
gall’ry steps, ‘times is hard an’ they’s gwine
ter be harder. I’se got ter do my bit fer
dis ’ere depresshun like eve’y one else. Dat
is why I’se a-cuttin’ you down from six
ter three. De three what am de oldest can
clear out. Dey ain’t wu’th as much ter
me.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The dirty dog!” Bill’s face was hot
with anger.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should say so!” Dorothy’s tone
matched Bill’s in vehemence.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Abe shook his head. “De Good
Book say, ‘Him what has, gits, and him
what ain’t got nuffin’ gits dat nuffin’ tuk’n
away’,” he remarked a bit sadly. “But dis
hyar niggeh ain’t got no complaint, ma’am.
Ol’ Man River has sho’ got a warm cabin.
He ken trap Brer Rabbit in de woods, and
’times he gits Brer Possum. Marse Johnson
pays fer a spell o’ work once in a while
and dat pays foh things he haster buy over
to de store. I kinder git de idee, Missy, dat
dis hyar ol’ man is livin’ on de top o’ de
worl’.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, maybe,” answered Dorothy, “but
I call it doggone mean, just the same. Tell
me, Uncle, outside of being mean and
heartless, what sort of man is this John J.
Joyce?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Waal, you see’d how he done me,
Missy. Jes’ git up an’ go—didn’t say he
wuz sorry or nuffin’. He’s rich and he’s
sharp. Maybe he’s honest, I don’t know,
but I’se allus thought as how Marse Conway
’ud done better if he’d er hoed his
own ’taters. But I reckon dis niggeh
hadn’t oughter be crit’sizin’ de quality.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Quality, nothing!” exploded Bill. “Mr.
Conway was all right—at least, George
is—but the other fellow is the worst kind
of a polecat!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Den yo’all knows Marse George?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, Uncle, he’s a friend of ours,” said
Dorothy. “And he is right up to his neck
in trouble just now. Anything you can
tell us about his father will be a big help.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Abe pushed his plate away and
leaned his elbows on the table.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dey ain’t much I kin tell,” he announced,
“but I’se knowed Marse George
since he wuz a l’il boy. He wuz allus nice
an’ friendly with Uncle Abe.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You say that his father and Mr. Joyce
were friends—that they had dealings of
some sort together?” Dorothy inquired.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaas, ma’am. Dey wuz pardners in
bizness, I reckon. Leastways, like you
said, dey had dealings togedder.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But if Joyce was in business with Mr.
Conway, why didn’t Stoker mention that?”
asked Bill of Dorothy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps he didn’t know about it, Bill.
He was away at school, remember, most
of the time. And he told us that his father
never spoke of his affairs or encouraged
him to ask questions.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But it doesn’t sound reasonable, Dorothy.
A fellow must know the name of
his father’s firm.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s true, in a way. But maybe there
was no firm—of Joyce and Conway? Isn’t
it possible that Mr. Joyce may have acted
as Mr. Conway’s agent—sold the inventions
for him, perhaps? Mr. Conway was
not a business man. He was always too
occupied in his laboratory or in his workshop.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dat am de way it wuz, Missy,” broke
in the old darky eagerly. “’Times, de
gennemen ’ud walk in de garden an’ talk
while dis hyar niggeh done his weedin’
or plantin’ or wotnot—neveh done pay
’tenshun ter Ol’ Man River. He don’t
count fer nuffin’ atall. Marse Conway
done make his ’ventions—Marse Joyce
done what he call ‘put ’em on de market.’
Is dat what yo’all wanter know, ma’am?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, thank you, Uncle. I believe I’m
beginning to see light at last.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Blest if I do,” commented Bill. “Joyce
couldn’t try to steal patents registered in
Mr. Conway’s name, could he?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy smiled. “That can wait. It’s
time we helped Uncle Abe wash up. Then
maybe he’ll let us have a couple of blankets
to spread before the fire. We’re dead for
sleep and we’re keeping him up too.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The old fellow started to answer, then
cocked his head and lifted a warning hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is folks a-follerin’ yo’ chill’un?” he
asked suddenly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” said Dorothy, “and they mustn’t
catch us!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dey’s someone a-comin’,” he whispered.
“Don’ yo’ say nuffin’. Jes do like
Uncle Abe tell yo’all and he fix it so nobody
can’t find nuffin’ hyar!”</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>“Take dose clo’es by de fire yonder,” directed
the sharp-eared old man, “an’ go
in de back room an’ shin up de wall shelves
to dese fo’-by fo’s oveh our heads. Tote de
clo’es ’long wid yo’ an’ lay flat on dem
boards. ’Times I trap somefin’ out er season—dis
niggeh’s got ter eat—dat dere’s
mah hidin’ place. Nobody can’t see yo’all,
nobody can’t fin’ yo’ dere!”</p>

<p class='c008'>While he talked and the others snatched
their half dried things from before the fire,
the old darky was clearing the table of
dishes. He flung the remains of the meal
onto the blazing logs and scooping up
the cups and plates, stacked them, dirty
as they were, on a shelf.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy and Bill ran into the back room
and scrambled up to the crossbeams. As
they crawled along the boards which were
laid close together in threes, they saw
Uncle Abe light an ancient corncob, then
pick up a tattered newspaper and sit down
by the fire. No more had they laid themselves
flat on their airy perch with their
bundles of damp clothing, than there came
a pounding on the cabin door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who dat?” called out Ol’ Man River
without moving from his chair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Open up, do you hear, River? I want
to speak to you,” barked a voice from out
the night.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaas, suh—comin’!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Peering through the cracks between
the boards, his guests saw him rise slowly
and shuffle to the door. Stretched out over
the little bed chamber, with their heads
close to the partition, they had an unobstructed
view of the lighted room beyond.
As the boards were laid over the middle of
both rooms and ran nearly the length of the
cabin, they realized with satisfaction that
unless someone stood close to the side wall,
it would be impossible to spy them out.
Uncle Abe’s oil lamp sent its gleams but
a few feet, and the rest of the room and
the crossbeams lay in deep shadow which
was an added protection to the hidden two.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ol’ Man River drew the bolt and swung
open the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Walk right in, Marse Joyce,” they
heard him say. And without waiting for
a reply, he hobbled painfully back to his
chair before the hearth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Three men stamped into the cabin and
banged the door shut on the storm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re keeping late hours, River,” the
leader of the party snapped out without
preamble.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the tones of his voice, Dorothy
and Bill knew him to be the same man who
had spoken to them in the valley meadow,
and who Bill had downed with the gasoline
tin. He was a short, stocky person
with a bulldog face and a scrubby toothbrush
moustache. He and his companions
looked tired and angry. They were
also very wet.</p>

<p class='c008'>The speaker walked over to the fire,
leaving a track of little pools across the
floor. Putting his hands over the blaze,
he scowled down at Uncle Abe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” he contended disagreeably, “I
said you were up late. Answer me, can’t
you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So yo’ say, Marse Joyce. So yo’ say.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Abe continued to gaze unconcernedly
into the fire as though he had no
idea the heavy set man was becoming
angrier by the minute.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You black whelp!” he thundered,
“What do you mean by bandying words
with me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Abe remained silent.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you deaf?” cried Joyce. “Tell me
what you’re sitting up for!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’se takin’ a warm, suh.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Taking a—<em>warm</em>?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaas, suh. I’se a mis’ry in der feet—rhumytizzem.
Can’t sleep nohow. So I
sets an’ reads de paper by de fire—an’ takes
a warm.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, you do, do you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaas, suh, I sho’ do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t answer me back that way, do
you hear?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The old darky continued to puff calmly
on his corncob.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Joyce thrust his hands in his pockets
and glowered at him. His companions
stood silently by, watching Uncle Abe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where are your visitors?” he asked
suddenly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill released the safety-catch on his automatic.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Abe puffed steadily on his pipe,
but said nothing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Answer me! Where are they?” snarled
John J. Joyce.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaas, suh!” The old darky removed
the corncob from his mouth and looked up
at his late employer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, why don’t you speak?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Kase yo’ done tell me not ter answer
a while back.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I tell you to answer me now.” Mr.
Joyce glared threateningly into his face.
“Are you just stubborn, or in your dotage?
<em>Where are your visitors?</em>”</p>

<p class='c008'>The old man spat with great precision
on to a glowing cinder. “Dey right hyar,
Marse Joyce,” he said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Right here? Where?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hyar in dis room, suh. All three o’
yo’.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, are you crazy, or am I?” Joyce
flung at him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, suh, I ain’ crazy,” returned the
old man, and Joyce’s companions broke
into a roar of laughter at this none too
subtle gibe.</p>

<p class='c008'>John J. Joyce turned on them furiously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shut up, you two! Go into that back
room and pull them out!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Still guffawing, the men disappeared
through the doorway in the partition.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nobody in here!” a voice sang out after
a moment.</p>

<p class='c008'>Joyce looked bewildered. Then he
picked up the lamp, walked to the open
door and looked into the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yank that bed apart!” he ordered.</p>

<p class='c008'>The two lying on the boards above his
head heard the men dragging the evergreen
boughs off the couch. Joyce said
not a word when their search was ended,
but turned on his heel and returned to the
front room, followed by his henchmen.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Didn’t think yo’d fin’ nobody,” remarked
Uncle Abe mildly, “If yo’ had, I’d
sho’ bin supprised!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So you’d been surprised, eh?”</p>

<p class='c008'>John J. Joyce had an unpleasant way of
repeating words. Now he stood over the
old man belligerently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaas, suh,” replied Uncle Abe with an
unconcern he probably did not feel. “I
could o’ tol’ yo’ dat dey’s nobody in dere.
Who yo’all a-lookin’ fo’?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What business is that of yours?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The old man remained silent.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you must know,” snarled Joyce,
“we’re looking for a young fellow and a
girl.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What dey doin’ uphyar in de woods at
dis time o’ night?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tryin’ to get away from us, I guess,”
said one of the men.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You keep your trap shut, Featherstone,”
barked Joyce. “I’m not paying
you to talk. This is my show, not yours.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, if you talk that way, you can run
it by yourself. I’m not your slave. Keep a
civil tongue in your head, Joyce—or I’ll
go back to the car—and go right now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That goes with me, too,” broke in the
second man gruffly. “What d’you take us
for—a pair of fools? I wasn’t hired to do
a marathon the length and breadth of the
forest on a soakin’ wet night. Those kids
ain’t here—let’s go!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, is that so? Well now you’ve had
your say, and you’ll go—when I get good
and ready,” sneered Joyce in his disagreeable,
domineering voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But what’s the use of hangin’ round?”
argued the first man. “I’m tired and I’m
hungry and I’m soaked to the skin—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And if I say the word to certain parties,
the two of you will be taking a longer
journey,” snapped their employer, “—a
little trip up the river that ends in a chair—a
red hot one. Shut up, both of you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He turned to Uncle Abe again. “Come,
River—out with it,” he commanded.
“Where have that boy and girl gone to?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How should I know?” Uncle Abe
knocked his pipe out on the hearth. “What
fo’ yo’all chasin’ dese hyar chillun in de
woods?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s my business. There are fresh
tracks leading along the trail right up to
your door.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dat may be, suh. Day may be. I ain’t
sayin’ dey isn’t, Marse Joyce.” He wagged
his head solemnly. “I wuz out myse’f
e’rlier in de evenin’.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Huh! You wouldn’t leave two sets of
tracks!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaas, suh, Marse Joyce—goin’ an’
comin’.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy, from her perch above, smiled
at the old darky’s astuteness. Their tracks
were on the trail, of course, for those who
followed to read; but the rain had long ago
blurred the outlines. Their pursuers could
not know in which direction the footprints
led.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So you think it was your tracks we followed?”</p>

<p class='c008'>John J. Joyce continued to speak in the
harsh, bullying tone that made Dorothy
want to kick him. She realized, nevertheless,
that the old darky’s last statement was
proving a serious facer to his inquisitor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I ain’t a-gwine ter say jes’ dat,” returned
Uncle Abe. “All I knows is dat I made
tracks on de trail. If dey’s more’n two
pair, dey ain’t mine.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What trails were you on?” came the
sudden question, and Dorothy tingled with
excitement as Uncle Abe hesitated.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lemme see, suh—why, I wuz down de
Spy Rock Trail, an’ de Cross Trail. And
den I wuz ’long de Overlook and de Raven
Rock Trails—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A nice long walk you had on a wet
night,” sneered the white man.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Abe was imperturbable. “Yaas,
suh.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t believe a word of it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dat yo’ priv-lige, Marse Joyce.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, it doesn’t sound likely to me, especially
when you say you’ve rheumatism
in your feet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’se gotter eat, suh.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s that got to do with it? There
are no stores on these trails. What do you
pretend you were doing, anyway?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ol’ Man River chuckled gently. “Baitin’
traps.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Catch anything?” Joyce sneered. “I
don’t suppose you did.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Den you’s a mighty bad ’sposer, suh.
Kaze I done cotch dat der rabbit yonder!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Following the direction of his pointed
finger, Dorothy saw for the first time that
a large jackrabbit hung from a crossbeam
in a corner.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s no go, Joyce,” broke in one of the
henchmen. “This nigger doesn’t know
where those kids are. Let’s beat it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Joyce, who had unbuttoned his coat,
fastened it up again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“For once you’re right,” he admitted
truculently. “It’s time we got back to the
car. That pair have holed in for the night
somewhere else. We’ll watch the reservation
entrances in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good night, suh, and a pleasant walk!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy had hard work to repress her
laughter. She loved this spunky old negro.</p>

<p class='c008'>Joyce turned angrily upon him. “You
keep a civil tongue in your face, River!”
he menaced. “In the first place, this is a
state preserve, and poaching is severely
punished; and secondly, you have no right
to be squatting in this shelter, I—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pick on someone your size, Joyce,”
advised the man who had spoken before.
“This old nigger ain’t doin’ you nor anyone
else any harm. Leave him alone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s two to one, Joyce. Come on!” said
the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a moment Dorothy thought there
would be a row. Joyce looked as though
he would burst with rage. But evidently
thinking better of it, he turned his back
to the fire and strode over to the door. Without
another word, he opened it and disappeared
into the black night.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was followed immediately by the two
men. The one who had spoken for Abe
swung round in the doorway.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know you’re a good hearted old liar,
Uncle,” he whispered. “And if you think
a minute you’ll know why I know it!
Don’t blame you. Joyce has a nasty temper
and no matter where those kids are, we’ll
round ’em up in the morning, anyway.
Good night!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“’Night,” returned Ol’ Man River.
“Pleasant walk, suh!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yep. The joke’s on us,” grinned the
other and shut the door behind him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill and Dorothy were about to move
from their cramped positions when they
saw the old man raise a finger to his lips
in warning as apparently he studied the
glowing embers of the fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>The door suddenly opened and the
same man stuck his head in.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re a sly old fox,” he said. “I know
you’ve got those kids hidden somewhere.
Maybe they’re listening for all I know, and
I can tell you, Uncle, they are getting a
rotten deal. Joyce calls me Featherstone.
Here’s my card. Give it to them. G’d-night.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A bit of white pasteboard fluttered to the
floor as the door slammed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Abe got stiffly off his chair, shuffled
over to the door and sent the bolt home.
Then he picked up the card.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill pushed the pile of damp clothing
off the boards, then swung himself down
to the floor. Dorothy was beside him as
he turned to catch her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Uncle Abe,” she said, taking the old
man’s hand, “you are kind and you’re
good, and you are very, very brave. Bill
and I can never properly thank you for
all you’ve done for us tonight.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say no mo’ ’bout it,” protested Uncle
Abe, when Bill put his hand on his
shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look here, Uncle Abe,” he broke in,
“you’re one of the grandest guys I know.
Some day perhaps we can even up things a
bit. You ran a big risk for us, you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The old man smiled and blinked at them
for a moment. “Then, yo’all must be
sleepy—I sho’ is. You kin take the back
room if you will, Missy. Marse Bill an’
me’s gwine ter hit de hay in here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who was that man, Uncle Abe?” asked
Dorothy, stifling a yawn with the palm of
her hand. “What did his card say, I mean?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Spec’ he’s a deteckative, Missy. De
card say ‘Michael Michaels, Private Inquiry
Agent’.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Evidently he’s got his eye on Joyce,”
summed up Bill. “Wonder who he’s working
for?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What interests me more just now,” said
Dorothy, “is how Mister Michael
Michaels knew we were hidden here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The old man chuckled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s sho’ ’nuf a smart man, Missy. It
wuz de tracks on de trail. He know’d I
done never make dem tracks. He know’d
dey wan’t nobody else’s but yourn.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How come, uncle?” asked Bill.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dat jackrabbit a-hangin’ yonder done
it, suh.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But what’s that rabbit got to do with
our tracks?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Marse Michaels, he must o’ touched
dat bunny. Den he know’d it wan’t never
trapped today. Dat bunny’s stiff ez er
hick’ry log!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy and Bill burst into laughter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bet you were scared silly for fear Joyce
might examine it and realize that you
hadn’t been out tonight!” said Bill.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dat’s right, sho’ nuf, Marse Bill.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You know, Mr. Michaels may be a big
help to us,” remarked Dorothy, yawning
unashamedly in their faces this time.
“Well, I just can’t hold my head up any
longer. Good night, both of you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good night,” returned Bill and Uncle
Abe in unison.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy took herself off to the back
room and bed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch13' class='c009'><i>Chapter XIII</i><br /> <br />THE WAY OUT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The gray light of early morning crept
into Shelter No. 6 through the open shutters.
It brought to view two forms rolled in
blankets, sleeping soundly before the dying
embers of last night’s woodfire. In the
back room, Dorothy was curled up on the
fragrant bed of evergreens, deep in a
dreamless slumber. The storm of the evening
was gone, leaving in its place a fine,
steady drizzle. The air was chill and
damp. It bade fair to be another unpleasant
day.</p>

<p class='c008'>The hands of a battered alarm clock that
stood on the chimney shelf marked quarter
to eight, but the sleepers were motionless.
Then suddenly Uncle Abe sat up and
knuckled the sleep from his eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lordy, Lordy!” he grumbled, catching
sight of the clock. “Dose chillun wuz ter
git ’way early an’ dis hye’r nigger sleepin’
lak de daid. I speck de young Missy an’
Marse Bill need der sleep—an’ we’ll fool
Marse Joyce jus’ de same.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He got stiffly to his feet, stretched his
ancient arms above his head and set about
building up the fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>Presently Bill opened his eyes and
yawned. Then he threw off his blanket,
sat up and sniffed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bacon—eggs—coffee,” he murmured.
“Good morning, Uncle, you sure are an
A1. up to the minute chef!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hovering over a sizzling frying pan,
the old man turned his head and smiled at
Bill.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mornin’, Marse Bill. Yaas, suh, I
’low dat eatin’ brekfus’ an’ gettin’ it, too, is
de bes’ fashion what is.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You said it,” grinned Bill. “Say, I
guess we all overslept! Well, no use crossing
our bridges ’til we come to ’em. Any
place in this hotel where I can wash and
slick up a bit, Uncle?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sho’ is, suh. De soap an’ de towel an’
de bucket an’ de basin is over yonder by
de do’. When yo’alls done wid dem, p’raps
yo’ll wake de young missy, an’ carry de
bucket in yonder?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure will,” returned Bill, “but I’ll wake
her up first.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He went to the door in the partition and
banged his fist on the panels.</p>

<p class='c008'>“First call for breakfast in the dining
car ahead—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ummm—” responded a sleepy voice
from the back room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Time to get up, Dorothy. Hop to it,
kid!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m awake!” called back that young
lady.</p>

<p class='c008'>“O.K. When you’re ready, there’ll be a
pail of water outside your door.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thanks. Be with you in a jiffy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill crossed the room, sloshed water into
the tin basin and carried the pail back.
While he was immersed in his morning
ablutions Dorothy’s door opened and her
hand withdrew the pail.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill had no more than taken a seat at
the table, when she put in her appearance.
Dressed in the overalls, flannel shirt and
heavy wool socks of the night before, she
looked particularly bright and cheerful.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Morning, everybody!” she smiled.
“That bed of yours, Uncle Abe, is the most
comfortable one I ever slept on. Too bad
I had to turn you out of it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Reckon neither Marse Bill ner me
knowed what we wuz a-sleepin’ on, Missy.
I sho’ wuz daid ter ebbryt’ing all night
long. De flo’ ain’t discomfertubble, when
yo’ knows how ter lay on it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m kind of stiff,” admitted Bill. “But
I feel fifty million per cent better. Bet I
never moved from the time I turned in until
the smell of breakfast woke me up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My!” exclaimed Dorothy, peeking into
the frying pan. “Where did all these swell
eggs come from, Uncle?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The old darky chuckled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dat’s one o’ de two things a white pusson
mus’nt never ask no color’d pusson,
Missy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And what’s the other?” Dorothy inquired
with twinkling eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where a nigger gits his chickens.”</p>

<p class='c008'>All three of them laughed this time and
sat down to breakfast.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the meal there was little conversation.
Both Dorothy and Bill were
frankly hungry and each was silently puzzling
a way out of their predicament.
Uncle Abe, always affable, nevertheless,
rarely if ever volunteered advice unless
called upon. In his mind, to do otherwise
would have been a breach of good manners.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill drained his second cup of coffee and
met Dorothy’s look.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Got any ideas?” he asked her.</p>

<p class='c008'>She shook her head and pushed her
chair back from the table. “No, I haven’t,”
she confessed gravely. “But if I’m any
judge of bad character, Mr. John J. Joyce
will keep his promise. Too bad we slept so
long.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe,” said Bill. “But without that
good rest, we’d have been dead ones today.
The tough part of it is that Joyce’s men
will be posted at all the reservation entrances
now—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And on the trails around this shelter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very likely. If we could ditch those
guys and hike over to a road, we might
get a lift out in somebody’s car. Lots of
people drive in here on Sundays.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not in weather like this, Bill. No, even
if we did persuade someone to give us a
lift, we’d be soon seen and stopped.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill suddenly brought his fist down upon
the table.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re a pair of idiots,” he declared.
“Joyce’s men won’t stop us. They’ll be
looking for Stoker Conway and a girl.
Keep those clothes on you’re wearing, and
with my old hat, all they’ll see is a couple
of fellows on a tramp. Nobody’d take me
for George Conway. Why, we’ve got
nothing to worry about!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s where I differ with you. We
most certainly have plenty to worry us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But how come, Dorothy?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How do we know that friend Joyce
hasn’t got hold of Stoker and possibly
Terry, too?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then—if he has, he won’t want us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes, he will. You can bet your
boots, Mr. Joyce isn’t letting anyone go
whom he may think was mixed up in last
night’s affair.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill looked surprised. “But Joyce can’t
go on kidnapping people,” he argued. “Or
rather he can’t keep on trying to kidnap the
whole bunch who were in Stoker’s house
last night, and then hold them indefinitely.
Even if he caught us all, he couldn’t hold
us long.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Long enough to get what he thinks
Stoker has got—and make his getaway, if
necessary. At least that’s how I figure it.
If he catches any of us we’re not likely to
come in personal contact with him. He’s
too smart to give himself away like that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Possibly you’re right. But if he did
catch any of us, he’d soon find out that
Stoker and the rest of the bunch know less
about this mysterious something he’s after
than he does himself!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy smiled. “Rather involved, but
I think I fathom your meaning. You seem
to forget, Bill, that when Betty and I butted
into this thing up at the Conway house,
a couple of strong-arm men were starting
to heat a poker. I don’t think Mr. Joyce’s
hospitality will prove a pleasant experience
if we are caught by him or his men.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, we’ve got to get off this reservation—how
are we going to do it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Blest if I know,” she admitted candidly.
“But we’ve just got to find a way. And
look here, Bill—I know you think I’m all
steamed up over a trifle—but I honestly
believe that whatever Joyce is trying to
steal from Stoker is so enormously valuable
that he’s determined to risk pretty
nearly everything short of murder to gain
possession of it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wouldn’t put murder past him,
either,” said Bill.</p>

<p class='c008'>“His actions prove he’s in deadly earnest,”
Dorothy went on, and then turned to
Ol’ Man River, who was peacefully puffing
his pipe. “You’ve heard what we were
saying, Uncle Abe. Have you any suggestions
to give us?”</p>

<p class='c008'>That ancient colored gentleman removed
the corncob from between his teeth
and pursed his lips. “Waal, yaas, m’am.
I reckon Marse Johnson is de answer to yo’
question,” he said thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, he’s the reservation superintendent—you’re
right, Uncle Abe—he can do
it if anyone can. Why didn’t we think of
him before?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dat am so, Missy. Der ain’t a-gwine
nobody ter stop yo’all long wid Marse
Johnson.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s a great idea, Uncle,” applauded
Bill. “The super’s house is right across
the reservation from here, if I recall
rightly?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaas, suh, it am. Right down yonder
where de Boutonville road come out far
side ob de reservation t’ard Cross River.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Think you could pilot us down there
and give those guys in the woods the miss?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I speck dese men ain’t gwine ter git
familious wid us if yo’ foller Ol’ Man
River. I’se boun’ we-all sho’ give ’em de
bestes’ game er hide an’ seek dey ez ever
had. It ain’t a-gwine be easy, Marse Bill.
But I’ll git yo’all down yonder and den
you kin carry de young Missy home in a
kyar. Marse Johnson, he’s got three automerbiles.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope it’ll be as easy as you say,”
grinned Bill, amused by the old man’s
earnestness. “I’ll make a bundle of Miss
Dorothy’s clothes and then the best thing
we can do is to get started.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’se got a pair er sneakers dat you kin
wear, Missy,” Uncle Abe announced.
“Dey ain’t no count nohow, but dey’s got
sol’s an’ dat sho’ am better dan walkin’ in
dose socks.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thanks a lot, Uncle, you’re such a
grand help to us—” She smiled at the old
man and he fairly beamed. “I’ll love wearing
them. But first of all, we’ll heat some
water and wash dishes. Don’t look so annoyed,
Bill. We’ve got plenty of time, now,
and there’s nothing more slovenly than letting
the dishes go after a meal. We did it
because we had to last night, but I intend
to leave Uncle Abe’s cabin just as spick and
span as we found it. You fetch some water
and heat it while Uncle Abe scrapes the
plates. In the meantime I’ll straighten up
the back room and sweep out the house.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy was as good as her word. By
the time the dish water was hot, her bed had
been made, the cabin swept and generally
put to rights. Then she brought out the
dishpan and washed both the supper and
breakfast dishes while Bill and Uncle Abe
dried them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Some swell housekeeper,” said Bill to
Uncle Abe with a grimace, “and she knows
how to make the men folks work, too!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“An’ dat am ez it should be,” declared
the old darky solemnly. “De Good Book
say, ‘what am food fo’ de goose am good
eatin’ fo’ de gander’....”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know whether that’s a compliment,
or not, Uncle,” laughed Dorothy.
“But you see, it didn’t take long, and I feel
better knowing everything’s clean.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is your ladyship ready to go now?”
asked Bill.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Quite ready—thank you so much.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then let’s shove off. What you said
about Stoker and Terry a while ago has
got me worried, I must admit. I want to
get to a telephone just as soon as possible.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Abe left the cabin first. After
scouting about in the cold drizzle for a few
minutes, he came back and declared that
the way was clear.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I gen’rally goes ’long Overlook Trail
an’ down de Cross River Road ter git er
Marse Johnson’s house,” explained the
old man, once they were outside the cabin.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But dis mornin’ we ain’t gwine dat-away—t’aint
safe. Yo’ all stick close behin’
Ol’ Man River, an’ sing out ef he’s
a-travelin’ too fast. Dis ain’t no easy trail
we’se takin’.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He struck directly into the woods and
for the next hour Dorothy never even
sighted a path. She soon found out that
when Uncle Abe described this as ‘no easy
trail,’ he was telling the unvarnished truth.
Dorothy was no Alice-sit-by-the-fire. She
had been on some stiff hikes before this, but
the ancient negro led them up hill and
down dale, through the tangled undergrowth
or virgin forest dripping wet with
rain. And he led them through this wilderness
of trees and rocks at a perfectly amazing
rate of speed. Until Dorothy caught
her second wind, she was hard put to keep
up.</p>

<p class='c008'>If Joyce had men out, they never saw
them. In fact, except for an occasional
bird or small forest animal scuttling away
in their advance, they neither saw nor
heard any living thing. Eventually they
climbed the steep side of a wooded ridge
and stopped.</p>

<p class='c008'>Below them, through the trees Dorothy
made out woodland meadows, stretching
down to a road which ran along their side
of the valley. Lower down and paralleling
the highway, a winding river ran down
the vale. Lying in broad fields near the
river to their left was a large farm house
and barns.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Cross River Road, Cross River, and
Marse Johnson’s house,” announced
Uncle Abe, using a hand and forearm for
a pointer. “Dat highway yonder what
runs inter de Cross River Road near de
house ez de Honey Holler Road. Right
dar am de Cross River entrance, an’ right
dar ez ’zackly de place whar ol’ man
Joyce’s gang am hangin’ out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s going to be a job to get down there
without being seen,” remarked Bill.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Der ain’t nobody gwine ter see us,”
protested the old darky, “kaze soon ex we
git ter der open, you an’ me an’ Missy am
gwine ter ben’ down low an’ hug de far
side er de stone fences. But we’alls stayed
hyar confabbin’ long ’nuf. Got ter git
goin’ ag’in.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He moved off down the slope, the others
following. By dint of doing exactly as he
advised, fifteen minutes later found them
ringing Mr. Johnson’s doorbell.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dese young people am fren’s er mine,
Miz Johnson,” Uncle Abe told the
motherly person who opened the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Step right in,” she invited with a smile.
“Lands sakes, you’re drippin’ wet. Come
in by the kitchen range and get dried out.
You must be perishin’—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thanks. May I use your telephone?”
inquired Bill as he spied a wall instrument
in the hall.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course you can,” beamed Mrs.
Johnson. “There’s a book on the table
there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you, I know the number.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Going to call up Stoker?” asked
Dorothy in a low tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes. You and Uncle Abe go into the
kitchen and get warm. I’ll be with you in
a minute or two.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But it was not until a good five minutes
later that Bill put in his appearance.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Everything all right?” demanded
Dorothy from her seat on a kitchen chair
close to the coal range.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m afraid not,” Bill looked worried.
“They don’t answer the phone.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch14' class='c009'><i>Chapter XIV</i><br /> <br />THE LION’S DEN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“No answer at all?” Dorothy inquired
anxiously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s what I said.” Bill’s tone was a
bit gruff. He walked over to the range
and warmed his hands at the glowing
coals.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What I mean is, could you hear the
bell ring in Stoker’s house?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes, the bell rang. But nobody
came to the phone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s what I wanted to know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why? I can’t see that the ringing of
the phone bell makes any difference—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All the difference,” declared Dorothy.
“Never mind why, now. I’ve just told
Mrs. Johnson that I had to park <em>Wispy</em>
on the other side of the reservation last
night, and that some men over there were
very disagreeable and we were forced to accept
Uncle Abe’s hospitality for the night.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We think a heap of Uncle Abe on the
reservation,” affirmed the superintendent’s
wife. “And don’t you worry about your
airplane, Miss Dixon. We’ll see that it
don’t come to no harm. My husband
had to drive over to Katonah this morning,
but I’ll get Sam Watson on the job.
He’s in the office right now. Sam!” she
called, “come in here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A stalwart, broad-shouldered young
man walked into the kitchen. His natty
uniform marked him a member of the Reservation
force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you want something, Mrs. Johnson?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is Miss Dorothy Dixon of New
Canaan, and Mr.—” she hesitated.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bolton—Bill Bolton,” supplied that
young man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The flyers!” Guard Watson’s honest
face wore a broad grin. “Heard about
you both—who hasn’t? Pleased to meet
you, I’m sure.” He shook hands with them
and nodded to Uncle Abe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s like this, Sam,” explained Mrs.
Johnson. “Miss Dixon run out of gas last
night and her airplane is down to the woodlot
just below Raven Rocks in the Stone
Hill River valley. Get Eddie, that’s his
beat anyway, and keep an eye on the airplane
until these young folks pick it up
this afternoon. They had trouble with
some tramps over there last evenin’ and put
up to Uncle Abe’s for the night. Pass the
word on to the rest of the boys about them
dead beats that’s botherin’ people on the
Reservation, will you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I sure will, Mrs. Johnson. If they’re
still around, we’ll run ’em off quicker’n
greased lightning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re very good,” smiled Dorothy.
“We saw a couple of suspicious characters
hanging round the Cross River entrance
when we came over here to headquarters
just now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll rout ’em out,” Sam Watson promised.
“If they kick up a fuss they’ll put
in thirty days behind the bars. Well, I must
be hoppin’ it. Glad to have met you folks,
I’m sure. So long, everybody!”</p>

<p class='c008'>With a stiff salute and a broad smile he
was gone. They heard him tramp down
the hall and then the front door slammed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Checkmate to J. J. J.,” murmured Bill.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy played chess with her father—“Not
checkmate—check,” she corrected.
“By the way, Mrs. Johnson, I wonder if we
can trespass on your good humor still further?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Land’s sakes alive! I haven’t done
nothing for you yet!” The superintendent’s
wife was busy with hot water and a
teapot.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you happen to have an extra car
that we could borrow for a few hours?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, sure I have, my dear. But there’s
no hurry about your leavin’, is there? A
cup of tea, now, to warm you up and some
of these nice crisp crullers I made yesterday?
Then I’ll get you and Mr. Bolton
some dry things to put on and after dinner
you can take the car and ride home.
How’ll that be?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy laughed and shook her head.
“You’re awfully kind, really, Mrs. Johnson,
but we can’t stay. We’ve got an appointment
that just can’t be broken.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But your wet clothes, Miss Dixon?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thanks for your offer, but we aren’t so
wet now. I will have a cup of tea if I may,
although we only finished breakfast a little
while ago.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And don’t forget those crisp crullers,”
protested Bill with a grin. “I certainly do
love homemade crullers, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“An’ dey ain’t nuffin’ better ’an de ones
Miz Johnson makes,” chuckled Uncle
Abe. “I’se tasted ’em befo’ an’ dis hyar
nigger knows!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Johnson beamed delightedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Even if I do say so who shouldn’t,” she
remarked modestly, “this batch came out
pretty good. But are you sure I can’t
tempt you to stay for Sunday dinner?
We’re having fish chowder, chicken friccassee,
with dumplin’s, and a pumpkin
pie!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You sure do make my mouth water,”
groaned Bill. “I only wish we could stop,
and meet your husband, Mrs. Johnson. If
you’ll keep the invitation open, we’d love
to take advantage of it some other time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The good lady passed them their tea and
a plate heaped with golden brown crullers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll make it next Sunday noon then.
Our children are all married, with homes
of their own. Mr. Johnson and I miss not
having young folks round the house. It’ll
make it seem like the good old times again,
if you come. Don’t forget now, next Sunday.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll be here with bells on, Mrs. Johnson,”
promised Bill.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And we’ll try not to look like a couple
of tramps then,” added Dorothy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ll always be welcome, no matter
what you wear,” declared their hostess.
“I’ll make another pumpkin pie for you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They chatted for ten minutes or so and
then bade Mrs. Johnson goodbye.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Uncle Abe will take you out to the
garage,” she said in parting. “Take the
Buick. You’ll need a closed car on a day
like this.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When the kitchen door had shut out the
smiling, motherly figure, and they were following
the old darky along the drive,
Dorothy turned to Bill.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And they say that New Englanders are
not hospitable! Why, they’re the most hospitable
people in America if you really
know them!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Country people, no matter what part of
the United States they live in, are generally
friendly. Living in cities, where your next
door neighbor is a stranger, makes a person
suspicious. But I’ve found that most
honest-to-goodness Americans will do a
lot for a person in trouble.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dere’s de kyar, Missy,” Uncle Abe interrupted
apologetically. “Reckon dis
hyar ol’ nigger’ll wish yo’all goodbye an’
mo’ comferble beds ternight.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy caught the old fellow’s hand
and held it between her own.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Uncle Abe,” she said, looking straight
into his shining eyes, “do you really like
living up there in the woods, all by yourself?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Waal, dis nigger ain’t used ter much,
Missy,” he said slowly, “an’ de cabin am a
heap better ’an a barn er no roof atall. But,
it sho’ do get mighty lonesome, ’times.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I bet it does. How would you like to
live in quarters over our garage and work
for my father? He was saying only a day
or so ago that what with driving the cars
and all Arthur has too much to do around
the place. We need a gardener and general
handy man. The job is yours if you’ll
take it—and I don’t mind saying I’ll feel
badly if you don’t.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ol’ Man River winked back the tears
with a brave effort, although the little
wrinkles at the corners of his mouth puckered
in a smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yo’ sho’ is good ter dis hyar nigger,
Missy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And you want to come? I won’t take
no for an answer—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It do me good fer ter hear you sesso,
Missy. Kaze yo’ sho’ is de qual’ty and dis
hyar ol’ nigger never done had no real
fambly ’time he come No’th.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill winked at Uncle Abe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And if that nocount Dixon family don’t
treat you right, you come right across the
road to my house.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Spect I’ll git ’long tollerbul well on
Miss Dor’thy’s side,” he chuckled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, what’s the good word now,
Dorothy?” Bill motioned toward the
Buick. “It’s about time we beat it over to
Stoker’s, don’t you think?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do think,” returned Dorothy. “And
that’s why we aren’t going over there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But surely—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But nothing. The boys aren’t there or
they’d have answered the phone. If you
hadn’t heard the bell ring we could be
fairly sure the wire was cut and that they
were holding the house in a state of siege,
so to speak. Now we know they aren’t
there.” Bill did not seem impressed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If that line of reasoning is logical, I’m
as cold on the right answer as a water tank
in winter. How do you know Joyce’s men
haven’t got them tied up in the house?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because at this stage of the game, Joyce
would hardly do that and leave them there
for their friends to find. And if his men
were still in the house, they’d be sure to
answer the telephone. You and Uncle Abe
get right into that Buick now. We are going
to take a run up to Mr. John J. Joyce’s
place.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill did not attempt to hide his astonishment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gee, whiz, Dorothy?—you’ve got a
whale of a lot of nerve!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy shrugged and looked steadily
at Bill. “Well, are you game?”</p>

<p class='c008'>For answer he followed her into the car.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pretty much like jumping feet first into
the lion’s den,” he commented, “but considering
your middle name is Daniel, or
ought to be, I dare say we’ll have a roaring
good time of it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stop talking jazz, Bill. How about
you, Uncle Abe?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The old man already lounged back on
the rear seat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Reverse dis hyar injine inter de drive,
Miss Dor’thy—an’ when yo’all turned
round I’se gwine ter show yo’ where we’se
a-gwine.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy, smiling over the steering
wheel, backed out of the garage and got
the Buick headed toward the road.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, Uncle?” she prompted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“D’reckly in front of us, way over yonder
on de far hill ez er big house.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The white one in the trees?” asked Bill.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaas, suh, de only one any pusson kin
see from hyar. Dat am Hilltop, Marse
Conway’s ol’ place.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where Mr. Lewis lives now!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Eggzackly so, ma’am. Marse Joyce’s
place ez jus’ back er yonder.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bet he calls it, ‘The Den,’” said Bill.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Abe cackled, “No, suh, Marse
Bill—hee-hee—dat house done called
‘Nearma’.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Near ma?” repeated Dorothy in a puzzled
tone. “There are some queer Indian
names in this part of the country, but that’s
a new one on me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“’Tain’t Injun, Missy. Dat dere hones’
ter goodness ’Merican. Marse Joyce’s ol’
Ma uster lib cross de ridgeroad. Dat how
he come ter name de house ‘Near Ma’.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That old scurmudgeon! I don’t believe
it!” cried Bill in an explosion of laughter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dat am de spittin’ trufe, Marse Bill. De
ol’ lady am daid, but he still call de place
Nearma jus’ de same.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How do we get to it, Uncle?” Dorothy
asked after a moment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Run out de entrance till we come ter
de turnpike, Missy. Den right, long dat
road to Cross River. From de village yonder
we follers de road ter Lake Waccabuc,
but we don’t hafter travel dat far.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good enough.” The car swung round
the side of the house and into the road.
“I guess Sam got rid of the Watchers by
the Gate—there’s nobody at the entrance.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They swept into the highroad and on
through the pre-revolutionary hamlet of
Cross River. Half a mile further, as they
were speeding along the top of a wooded
ridge, Uncle Abe spoke again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dat stone fence long de road ter de
right b’long ter Hilltop,” he pointed out.
“De house am set way back from de road
behin’ de trees. Round de bend ahead yo’all
gwine ter see ’nother higher wall, dat
starts by three white birches. Yonder am
where Marse Joyce’s land begins.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And what’s on the farther side of the
Joyce property?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dere ain’t nuffin, Missy, ’cept jes’ mo’
dese hyar woods.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Fine! And I suppose, after being up
here for nearly ten years, you can find your
way about in those woods?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sho’ can, Missy. Ef dere’s er rabbit
hole dis nigger a’ missed in dem woods, I
wanter know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Better and better. You’re a marvellous
help, Uncle Abe.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you plan to do? Park the car
near the road, hike back through the woods
and cut over toward the house from that
side?” Bill was not enthusiastic.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just about that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And when you sight the historic mansion?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m going into the house.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes, you are...”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes, I am!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And how do you expect to do that without
being nabbed right off the bat?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Last night you told me I asked too many
questions, Bill. And Uncle Abe says
‘what’s food for the goose is swell eating
for the gander...’!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch15' class='c009'><i>Chapter XV</i><br /> <br />IN THE TOILS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Ef yo’ll pahdon my sayin’ so, Miss
Do’thy,” volunteered Uncle Abe as the car
was run into the underbrush beyond the
Nearma wall and parked behind a clump
of scrub oak and evergreens, “I ’lows as
how it sho’ would er bin better ter ’proach
de house from de odder side. We could
er travelled down Marse Lewis’ place and
come in dat-a-way. Dere’s mo’ lan’scapin’
on dat side.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thanks for the suggestion, Uncle,”
Dorothy locked the ignition. “But I think
we’ll keep just as far away from Mr. Lewis’
property as we can, for the present.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you think he really is mixed up with
J. J. J. in this business?” Bill asked her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can’t say—it certainly looks like it—and
we’ll take no unnecessary chances.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How about the chances we’ll take in
breaking into Nearma?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I said unnecessary! Anyway, I’m the
one that’s going in there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But look here, Dorothy! Do you think
I’m going to let you walk into that place
alone?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not alone, old dear. Uncle Abe is
coming with me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, is he? And what am I to do while
you’re in the house mixing it up with those
thugs? Do you expect me to stick out
here with the car and see that somebody
doesn’t steal the tires?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy looked amused. Bill was annoyed
with her and she did not blame him.
“You’ll have plenty to do, Bill.” She gave
his shoulder a good-natured pat and sprang
out of the car.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on, both of you. I’ll explain my
plan as we go. Lead the way, Uncle Abe.
I want to get to the kitchen door without
being seen from the house if possible.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Abe got out of the car. Bill was
already beside her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yo’all foller Ol’ Man River!” said the
ancient darky and led into the woods away
from the road.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, what’s the dope?” Bill’s tone was
less exasperated now, and side by side they
swung in behind the old man.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy took his arm. “I guess you
think I’m a brainless idiot,” she began,
“with all my wild schemes—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I don’t quite see your idea in going
in there alone—but it’s your show, so
go ahead and explain.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Attaboy! Now this is the point. I
want to do some scouting inside and I’ll
need you to cover me as it were. Uncle
Abe knows Joyce’s servants. And Mr.
Joyce is looking for you and me. Well,
don’t you see, if Uncle Abe brings a stray
<em>boy</em> into the kitchen for a bite to eat, it
won’t seem anything out of the way. In
these clothes, I’ll never be taken for a girl.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you won’t stay in the kitchen—I
know you!” Bill was not quite convinced.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps not—what I do inside will depend
on circumstances as I find ’em.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Humph! And what is my important
work to consist of?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want you to watch this side of the
house. If I need you, I’ll open a window
and wave. If it happens to be a window
on the ground floor, you can get in that
way. If I open a second story window,
come in through the kitchen. You’ve got
a gun—that ought to be a help.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But—suppose you aren’t able to get to
a window?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, then wait half an hour; when the
time’s up run down to Cross River in the
car and phone the state police and get them
up here just as soon as possible.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why not get them up here now?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because we really haven’t got anything
to go on. Chances are they wouldn’t come
and I want to be able to pin something good
and definite on Mr. John J. Joyce before
we get the police on the job.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill seemed impressed by her reasoning.
“I guess you’re right. If Stoker and Terry
are in Nearma and we can prove it, J. J. J.
will have a nice little charge of kidnapping
to face.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I want to get him for grand larceny
and conspiracy as well,” she returned.
“That may sound ambitious, but I want
to land that gentleman and his friends on
a bunch of counts that will send them to
Sing Sing for a very, very long time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You and me both. I don’t know what
Joyce’s plans are, but after listening to his
bark last night, I’ll bet they’re something
pretty rotten. Hello!—There’s Uncle Abe
beckoning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They caught up with the old darky who
was peering through the woods to their
right.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yonder’s de stone fence, Missy,” he
announced, “an’ beyon’ am Marse Joyce’s
prop’ty. De house am ’bout fifty yards
from de fence.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good. Bill, you go ahead and lay low
behind some of the bushes near the house.
Uncle Abe and I will be along in a minute.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Aye, aye, skipper. Take care of yourself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>With a wave of his hand he climbed the
low stone wall and disappeared into the
shrubbery on the Joyce grounds.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy turned to Ol’ Man River. “I
suppose you know the cook over there,
Uncle?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yaas, ma’am. Liza an’ me’s bin
frien’s fer ten years.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s fine. Now listen to what I say,
because you’ve got your part to play in this
affair and there mustn’t be any slipup.”</p>

<p class='c008'>For several minutes she talked earnestly
to the old negro.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is that all clear?” she ended presently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yaas, missy. I’ll do what yo’all tells
me to—but I ain’t ’zackly hankerin’ fer you
to do all dis.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy laughed. “Neither am I,
Uncle. But it’s just got to be done, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They climbed the fence as Bill had done
and set off in the direction of the house,
which soon came into view through the
shrubbery and trees. As they drew nearer,
Dorothy saw that Nearma was a large
white frame house with green shutters in
the conventional New England style. A
wide veranda ran along the front of the
house and on the far side a massive fieldstone
chimney broke the expanse of clapboard
between the rows of windows. The
drive swung round the front of the building
and turned sharply to the rear cutting
the wide lawn on the near side. The
grounds were beautifully landscaped. On
a bright summer’s day it must indeed be a
lovely spot. Just then it looked bleak and
drear in the steady autumn downpour.</p>

<p class='c008'>They reached the drive without sighting
Bill, and followed it to the back of the
house. Presently Uncle Abe was knocking
on the kitchen door.</p>

<p class='c008'>His second knock was followed by the
sound of footsteps and the door opened to
disclose an enormously fat negress whose
head was bound with a bright red bandanna.
The angry glare on her round
black face changed to a delighted grin as
she recognized her visitor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lord, lordy,” she exclaimed. “If it
ain’t Uncle Abe River hisself. Come in
outer de wet. You sure is a sight fer sore
eyes. Ain’t seen you nohow fer a month
er Sundays!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Liza bustled her callers through an outer
pantry into a spacious kitchen.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wuz over ter Cross River,” said Uncle
Abe, seating himself in a proffered chair.
“An’ you is allus so good an ’commydatin’,
Liza, I ’lowed I’d drop in an—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Find out whedder Liza would ask you
t’ dinner,” chuckled that good natured person.
“Reckon you ain’t livin’ so high
now’days in dat der cabin.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yo’ sho’ is a good guesser,” grinned
Uncle Abe. “But I likes ter see ol’ frien’s
an’ I wanted speshul ter ax if Marse Joyce
could gimme a spell o’ work rakin’ leaves
er sump’n.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Liza pursed her lips an shook her head
vigorously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“’Tain’t likely dat man’d give you
nothin’,” she said darkly. “De goin’s on
hyar lately is sure terrubul. Wat wid all
dese strange men in de house an’ de young
gemmun dey brought in han’cuffed las’
night—an’ right froo dis hyar kitchen too—I’se
jes’ ’bout ready ter give notice. But
I mustn’t say nothin’! Who is dis hyar boy
wid you, Uncle?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy made a quick decision. “Not a
boy, Auntie—a girl,” she said quietly.
“—And a friend of the young man who
was brought here last night.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sakes alive!” exploded the stout cook.
“Wat’s all dis I’m a-hearin’?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yo’all hearin’ de spittin’ trufe, Liza,”
chimed in Uncle Abe earnestly. “Miss
Do’thy am de qual’ty. Jes’ yo’ listen ter
wat she say.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy waited for no more comment.
With a few deft word strokes she painted
a vivid picture of last evening’s happenings
at the Conway house. Then having
aroused a wide-eyed interest in her story,
she went on to tell of the adventure in
Uncle Abe’s cabin and the morning’s experiences.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am not trying to make trouble between
you and Mr. Joyce,” she ended, “but
if you will help me to free that young gentleman—he
must be either George or
Terry—you’ll be doing a very fine thing
and my father will see you come to no
harm.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’se ’spected fo’ some time Marse Joyce
wuz er bad man,” said Liza, “but I ain’t askeert
of him. Wat you want I should
do, Miss Do’thy?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I just want you to tell me some things,
Liza. Then you go on getting dinner and
I’ll see what I can do for my friend.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hadn’t I better call in Marse Bill?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, not yet. If anything goes wrong
in the house I want to have someone on the
outside to phone for the police.” She
turned to Liza. “Do you know where Mr.
Joyce and his men are now?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, ma’am. Marse Joyce an’ most of
’em done gone somewheres in de big car—left
de house ’bout ’n hour ago.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How many are still here?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Two o’ dose no-count white men is
somewhere in de front part of de house.
An’ let me tell yo’all if dat white trash
comes a-bustin’ inter my kitchen agin, dey
a-gwine ter git a rollin’ pin bounced offen
dere skulls!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you can’t do it, Liza—I will—”
added Uncle Abe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ho—how come I can’t do it, Abe? You
jes’ watch dis pickaninny. I’ll bust ’em an’
bust ’em good!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy giggled. Liza’s description of
herself as a pickaninny had upset her gravity
for the moment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can see you’re both going to be useful.
But tell me, Auntie—do you know
where they’re keeping this young man?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s in de blue room, Missy. I done
tote up his breakfas’ to de do’. Marse
Joyce give de odder two girls de day off,
so I’se cook an’ waitress an’ chambermaid
today. You run along, Miss Do’thy an’
if dose cheap ivory rollers try ter git fresh—jes’
holler fo’ Aunt Liza—she’ll bust
’em!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy had started for the pantry
when Uncle Abe sprang out of his chair
and caught her arm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“’Scuse me, Missy,” he apologized then
went on eagerly—“I’se got er idee.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes? What is it, Uncle?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dey’s logs an’ dey’s kindlin’ in der
entry, missy. I done seen ’em when we
come in. Well, Miss Do’thy, you tote
some kindlin’—an’ I’ll carry a couple er
logs an’—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Fine! We’ll do it!” Dorothy’s alert
mind had grasped the plan before Uncle
Abe’s tongue could give utterance to it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“An’ de bes’ part of it is, honey,” grinned
Liza, “dat all de rooms on dis flo’ has fireplaces
an’ mos’ of dem upstairs too. Marse
Joyce, he’s a crank on open fires.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy chuckled. “Lucky break for
us.” She took a small armful of kindling
that Uncle Abe held out to her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yo’all better foller me,” said the old
darky, “I knows de way ’bout dis house,
Miss Do’thy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He pushed open a swinging door and
they slipped into a dining room, panelled
in white pine. It was an attractive room
and Dorothy decided that despite his criminal
traits, John J. Joyce was a man of taste.
Uncle Abe tiptoed across the room and
paused in the doorway to the hall.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We better see who’s downstairs befo’
we goes up,” he whispered, and trotted off
along the corridor.</p>

<p class='c008'>He stopped at a closed door near the foot
of the staircase and lifted his hand to
knock. But before his knuckles had
touched the panel, the heavy oak swung
inward and they were confronted by the
prizefighter whom Dorothy had last seen
heating a poker in the Conway house.</p>

<p class='c008'>“’Scuse us, suh. We’se bringin’ wood
fo’ de fire.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The big man glared at them for a moment.
Then apparently satisfied, he stepped
aside. “O.K. Thought I heard someone
snoopin’ around. Dump those logs in the
box and then get out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He paid no more attention to them.
Slouching stiffly in a big chair before the
fire, he became immediately engrossed in
the Sunday paper.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Abe dropped the logs into the
woodbox, and Dorothy knelt on the hearth
and piled her kindling beside it. In rising
to her feet her head brushed Uncle Abe’s
arm, knocking off the soft felt hat Bill had
loaned her. Quick as a flash she retrieved
it and thrust it back on her head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A boy with a girl’s bob!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy turned sharply and found herself
staring into the muzzle of an automatic.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stand right where you are,” barked the
big man, as he got up out of his chair. “And
you too, dinge—” The revolver swerved
for a second in Abe’s direction. “Ol’ Man
River and the girl, of course—we expected
you to show up. The laugh’s on you, all
right. Where’s your boy friend?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Right here!” Bill Bolton stepped from
behind the heavy window draperies, his
revolver trained on the gangster’s stomach.
“Drop that gun—drop it, or I’ll drill
you!” Then as the automatic crashed to
the floor, a smile spread over his tanned
face. “And this time the laugh is on you,
my friend,” he added softly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, <em>yeah</em>?” came a rasping voice from
the hall doorway. “You drop <em>your</em> rod,
bo’—and stick ’em up! Don’t move—you’re
covered. Now laugh that one off—ha-ha!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill’s gun fell to the floor and his hands
rose slowly upwards. In the doorway
stood the bald man—the other member that
Dorothy had spied on in the library of the
Conway house.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch16' class='c009'><i>Chapter XVI</i><br /> <br />THE BOOK</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The newcomer limped a couple of paces
into the room. His left arm and one leg
were swathed in bandages.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What price rock salt?” remarked Bill
pleasantly, still reaching toward the ceiling.</p>

<p class='c008'>Despite her qualms, Dorothy could not
help smiling. The bald man’s face became
scarlet with fury.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Another crack like that and I’ll give
you a taste of something harder than rock
salt,” her roared. “And when I get through
with him that guy who was so free with
his shotgun last night will wish he’d never
been born!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill ignored this outburst. “That gat
was my only weapon,” he announced without
rancor. “This house is in New York
State, so if you want to burn in Sing Sing,
shoot—I’m tired of holding up my arms.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He lowered his hands and thrust them
into his trousers pockets.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bald man looked daggers but he did
not pull the trigger. Instead he turned on
his partner.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why don’t you do something, Chick?”
he growled. “You know I’m laid up—oughta
be in bed right now, for that matter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, Eddie,” complained the burly fellow,
“I’m stiff as a board myself—I got
peppered all down my back and you know
it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Aw, quit yer grousin’. You can still
move around. Tie ’em up and we’ll dump
’em somewhere till the boss gets back.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yeah? An’ what do we use fer rope?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Eddie scratched his head with the butt
of his revolver and hobbled over to an armchair.
“Stick that gat in yer pocket,
Chick,” he ordered as he lowered himself
carefully into the deep cushions. “I’ve got
’em covered. Beat it into the kitchen—that
fat dinge in there’s got plenty of
clothesline. Help yerself and tell her I’ll
come in an’ bump her off, if she gets nasty!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Chick pocketed his revolver and started
to walk stiffly across the room when Liza’s
ample figure appeared in the doorway. In
her hands she bore a wooden mixing bowl,
brimming with cake batter. The whites of
her eyes gleamed dangerously, as she
glared at Chick; then she waddled into the
room and halted just behind Eddie’s chair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I done heard what yo’all said jes’ now,
bald man—” She shook her head slowly
from side to side and stared down at the
gangster’s hairless pate. “Seems ter me
you was talkin’ ’bout bumpin’ somebuddy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>With his gun covering the three prisoners,
Eddie was unable to look up at her.
Chick undoubtedly hailed Liza’s appearance
as relief from the painful necessity of
a walk to the kitchen. He sat down on
the edge of a chair opposite Eddie and
scowled at her sourly. Eddie took up the
conversation with the angry woman behind
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s right, nigger,” he chuckled
hoarsely. “We want some clothesline, to
tie up these here nuisances—an’ if you
don’t cough some up right now—I’ll bump
you off, see?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Reckon you got your names mixed—”
Without warning Liza brought the solid
mixing bowl down upon his unprotected
skull.</p>

<p class='c008'>Eddie collapsed beneath the forceful
blow and as he crumpled to the floor, Liza
flung the bowl and its contents in Chick’s
face. Then with an agility surprising in
one so cumbersomely made, she catapulted
herself at the astonished ruffian. Over went
his chair and they crashed in a tangled heap
of broken furniture, waving legs and cake
batter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill broke into a roar of laughter, but
Dorothy wasted no time in being amused
at this spectacle. She dove for Bill’s gun
which Eddie had not bothered to retrieve.
She ran over the struggling pair on the
floor and held the muzzle to Chick’s head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stop fighting!” she commanded. “Stop
it at once—”</p>

<p class='c008'>Chick sat up and tried to scrape the batter
out of his eyes. “I ain’t fightin’,” he
growled, “I’m half blind and I’m fair
smothered. An’ if me back ain’t broke it
oughter be! Take that Mack truck offen
my legs—I can’t move, much less put up a
scrap!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Get up, Liza!” Dorothy had to smile
at the fellow’s plight. With Bill’s help she
got the stout negress planted on her feet
again. Uncle Abe stood guard with a
poker over Eddie. That glum gentleman
was heralding his return to consciousness
with the most remarkable series of coughing
grunts.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This sure is the craziest rough house
I ever got mixed up in,” laughed Bill. “Old
Baldy over there sounds like a French pig
rooting for truffles—”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy grinned absent-mindedly, her
thoughts on the next move to be made.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll let dese two pigs burrer an’ grunt
down cellar,” declared Liza, straightening
her turban and smoothing down her apron.
“Dere’s a empty storeroom down dere—it’s
got a strong door an’ a good bolt, too.
Gimme a gun, please Miss Dor’thy. Me
an’ Uncle Abe can ’tend ter dis white
trash.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The negress walked over to Eddie, who
stared about the room, a dazed expression
on his face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Git up an’ come along.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then as Eddie continued to look at her
vacantly, she picked him up as if he were
a baby and draped him over her broad
shoulders.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yo’all go first, Liza,” said Uncle Abe.
He prodded Chick with the gun he had
taken from her. “Him an’ me’ll be right
behin’.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy and Bill watched the odd procession
pass from the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whew!” she exclaimed. “That was
a hectic five minutes. But how did you
happen to be in here?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Got tired of sticking round outside, so
slipped in by that window. Eddie was
asleep at the time, but he woke up right
afterward. Then you and Uncle Abe
walked in—and you know the rest. Say,
it must be Terry these guys nabbed.
Wonder what’s become of Stoker and
Betty?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Heaven only knows,” said Dorothy
wearily. “I’ll go up and let Terry out and
I think the best thing you can do is to phone
the state police. With Terry here, we’ve
got enough on Mr. John J. Joyce to hold
him, now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We sure have. Wonder what the J in
John J. Joyce stands for?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, it will stand for Jay, Jonah and
Jinx all in one, <em>if</em> you get the police here
before he comes back and sets his men free.
By the way, I may be going coo-coo with
all this, but it seems to me that I keep hearing
shots every now and then. There’s another—hear
it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Somebody’s probably potting bunnies
in the woods.” Bill seemed unconcerned.
“I noticed it just after I got in here. Beat
it upstairs now, and I’ll hunt up a telephone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy found the room where Terry
was held prisoner by the simple expedient
of opening each door as she came to it.
The fourth door was locked, but the key
was on the outside. It was no surprise to
her, upon opening it, to see her friend lying
on the bed. A quick glance showed
Dorothy that both windows were barred.</p>

<p class='c008'>Terry sprang up with a glad cry. “It’s
sure good to see <em>you</em>!” He gave her a
good-natured hug. “How in the world did
you manage this?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy told him as briefly as possible.
“What I want to know,” she said in conclusion,
“is how they happened to catch
you napping—and what’s become of
George Conway and Betty?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They didn’t catch me napping,” Terry
retorted. “You and Bill had been gone
about an hour and I expected Stoker back
from taking Betty home any minute. A
Ford drove into the garage, there was a
bang on the door and a voice sang out—‘Let
me in. It’s George.’ Well, I opened
up and—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It wasn’t George—” supplied Dorothy,
as usual going straight to the point. “Joyce
and his men nabbed you, of course. That’s
plain enough. But where are Betty and
George?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Search me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill burst into the room and stood breathless
before them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you get the police?” asked
Dorothy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Got headquarters all right. But what
do you think’s happened?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Spill it, Bill. This is no guessing bee,”
said Terry.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The sergeant told me they’d had a
phone call from Lewis. The old man was
frantic. Joyce and his gang were trying
to break into his house. The whole caboodle
from headquarters are up there
now, rounding up John J. Joyce and Company.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That accounts for the shots we heard,”
cried Dorothy. “Get on your rubbers,
Terry. We’re going to hike over to Mr.
Lewis’s place right now. I want to be in at
the finish.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I,” added Bill, “want to find out
what this mess is about!”</p>

<p class='c008'>They raced downstairs and stopping
only long enough to tell Liza and Uncle
Abe of this new development, set off for
the Lewis property adjoining.</p>

<p class='c008'>Following hasty directions given them
by the darkies, they hurried along a path
which led them to a gate in a high wall.
The gate was not locked and they continued
along the path which crossed the
Lewis estate. Presently the dim shape of a
large white house appeared through the
mist.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Halt!” A gruff voice arrested them as
they were about to ascend the steps at the
side entrance. A state trooper barred their
way. “Who are you—and what do you
want?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We are friends of Mr. Lewis,” said
Dorothy. She explained the circumstances
of their arrival.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, we’ve just sent Joyce and his men
to the lockup. The whole crew of ’em. We
corralled ’em proper. They’d busted into
the house, you know, and it sure would
have been a mixup if this fly cop that
horned in on the Joyce bunch hadn’t
clapped his gat to Joyce’s head and held
up their game until we got here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, that must have been Michael
Michaels—the private inquiry agent who
came to Uncle Abe’s last night,” said Bill.
“We’d like to go in the house, officer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“O.K. with me. There’s some kind of
a pow-wow goin’ on in the living room. I’ll
take you in there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He opened the door and led them across
the square hall into the living room. Here
they found a surprise awaiting them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Betty! George!” cried Dorothy. She
flew across the room to her friend. “I’m so
glad you’re safe. How did you get here?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, darling! It’s too exciting for
words!” gurgled Betty as they hugged each
other. “And George was so brave—he—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Lewis and his chauffeur stopped
our Lizzie last night,” broke in Stoker.
“Told us Joyce and his men were likely to
hold us up down the road. So we left the
Ford and came over here with Mr. Lewis.
And we’ve been here ever since.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Listen, George!” said that old gentleman,
and both girls giggled. “Hadn’t you
better introduce your friends? This young
lady in overalls is Miss Dixon, I take it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She certainly is,” smiled Stoker and
performed the necessary introductions.</p>

<p class='c008'>The other men in the room proved to be
Michael Michaels and an inspector of the
state police. For a few minutes everybody
seemed to be talking at once. Bill told
George and Mr. Lewis of his adventures
with Dorothy, while Terry explained his
capture by the Joyce gang to the inspector
and Michaels.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Listen!” said Dorothy and threw a reproving
glance at the others’ unsuppressed
smiles—“Will somebody please tell me
what Mr. Joyce has been trying to steal
from Stoker?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, that’s so,” interjected Mr. Lewis,
“you have no idea, of course—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, except that it’s probably mixed up
with that book, <em>Aircraft Power Plants</em>, I
think it’s called—”</p>

<p class='c008'>The old gentleman looked at her in unfeigned
astonishment. “Listen, Michaels!”
he cried. “She says this business is connected
with that book. Pretty good guess,
eh?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Certainly is,” returned the detective.
“But the book is a mystery in itself, and
one we haven’t yet solved.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But what <em>was</em> Joyce after?” interrupted
Bill with a show of impatience.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The plans, of course,” said Stoker Conway.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But what plans?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The plans of my father’s new aircraft
engine. I knew nothing about it until Mr.
Lewis told me last night.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where are the plans, and what has the
book to do with them?” broke in Dorothy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Listen, young lady,” began Mr. Lewis,
when Michaels the detective stopped him
with a gesture.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Better let me tell them, sir,” he suggested.
“These young people have a right
to know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The old gentleman nodded approval
and the detective, after biting off the end
of a cigar, continued to talk while the
others grouped about him. “About two
weeks ago,” he said, “Mr. Lewis called at
my New York office. There he told me the
following story. Six weeks before his
death, Mr. Conway came over here and
told Mr. Lewis that he had perfected plans
for an aircraft motor which would develop
very high power on a very small consumption
of gasoline.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s just what all the inventors are
after now,” interposed Bill.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, I should say so!” cried Dorothy.
“If <em>Wispy’s</em> motor didn’t lap up the gas
like a thirsty camel, I’d never have been
forced to land in that woodlot yesterday
afternoon!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All very interesting, I’m sure—”
Terry’s voice was sarcastic. “But do let’s
hear what Mr. Michaels is trying to tell
us!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s all right,” smiled the detective.
“Let’s see—where was I? Oh, yes, the
motor: well, the inventor told Mr. Lewis
that his partner and sales agent had ruined
him financially, and that now he was convinced
that he’d been swindled, and that
Joyce was a crook. Mr. Lewis suggested
Mr. Conway take the matter to the courts,
and offered to advance money for legal expenses.
Mr. Conway said he hadn’t sufficient
evidence for a case; that Joyce had
covered his tracks too well. Then he
spoke about the plans for this new motor
he’d just completed. He said that Joyce
knew about it and was trying to get control
of the thing; but that outside of stealing
the plans outright, Joyce could do
nothing, as the partnership had been dissolved.
And at the same time he told Mr.
Lewis that he knew he was suffering from
an incurable disease and could live but a
few months longer at most.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Listen, Michaels—let me tell it,” interrupted
old Lewis. “You are wandering
all over the place.... Your father,
George, said that should he have the new
motor built, Joyce would undoubtedly
make trouble, and he, Conway, wanted to
die in peace. He told me he was going
to entrust me with the plans and would
send them to me after he had made some
slight changes in them. And he said that
he would send me his check to cover the
expense of building and exploiting the engine.
‘After I’m gone, you attend to it for
George,’ he said. ‘That boy has no mechanical
ability, and he’s too young to market
a thing like this motor. Joyce or other
wolves like him would rob him of it in
twenty four hours.’ And that, was the last
time I saw John Conway alive.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The old gentleman pulled out a handkerchief
and blew his nose violently. “He
wouldn’t see me when I called, nor would
he mention the plans over the phone. He
died while I was in Boston on business.
When I got back the next day, I found a
package from him waiting for me. Of
course, I thought it would contain the
plans and his check. When I opened it
up I found nothing but a book—<em>Aircraft
Power Plants</em>, by a man named Jones. I
was naturally surprised, and searched its
pages from cover to cover, but found no
papers of any kind. I’ve even read every
word of it since then. And its pages have
been tested for invisible ink. But I’ve had
my trouble and pains for nothing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wonder why Father didn’t tell me of
those plans?” George remarked rather
wistfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That I can’t explain, my boy. As you
know now, I thought you had them. Either
that you had removed them from the book
before it left your house, or that your father
had changed his mind and given them to
you. Anyway, I decided to await developments.
Nothing happened until Joyce,
who had been in Europe since Conway’s
death, returned home a couple of weeks
ago. He came to see me and asked me outright
if I knew anything about Conway’s
airplane motor plans. I never liked nor
trusted Joyce, but I saw no harm in telling
him the truth. For of course I figured
that George must have set the wheels in
motion for the sale of the motor long before.
Joyce could do nothing about it at
this late date.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But to my astonishment, the man told
me the motor had not been marketed—that
he would have heard if any company
had bought it. ‘Either that boy’s got the
plans,’ he said, ‘or Conway had two copies
of the book and sent you the wrong one—’
I didn’t understand how the book came into
it and told him so. ‘Conway always sent
important papers through the mail by placing
them between the pages of a book,’ he
assured me. ‘Thought they would travel
safer that way.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, he changed the subject then, and
left. I got nervous about what I’d told
him, and hired Michaels to watch the fellow.
Michaels dug up a lot of things about
Joyce, and managed to get himself placed
on his staff of roughnecks. If he could
have been in two places at once, all this
trouble over at the Conway house last
night would never have come off.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy spoke from her place on the
couch beside Betty. “How did you happen
to go there last night?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wanted to find out if George really
had another copy of the book. Later I
learned from Michaels that Joyce’s men
had tried to torture the boy into telling them
where the plans were—and that then he
intended to kidnap him. I was on my way
over there to warn him when we met on
the road. He wanted to put young Walters
wise, but I was sure the Joyce gang
wouldn’t hurt his friend. I had promised
Michaels not to go ahead on my own hook
until I saw him. Perhaps I was wrong,
but I did what I thought was best for
George’s interests. I’ve heard since that
they just about tore the house apart, looking
for the other copy of that book!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you happen to have the copy that
was sent you, here in the house?” asked
Dorothy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes—right here, on the table.” Michaels
handed it to her.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dorothy pored over the book for a few
minutes, then laid it down. “Mr. Lewis,
do you mind if I take it home with me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, of course not—keep it as long
as you wish.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thanks,” she smiled. “Now, you gentlemen
want to plan about what to do with
Joyce and Co., and Bill and I have some
gas to buy and a plane to fly home. So I’ll
say <em>au revoir</em> for the present!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch17' class='c009'><i>Chapter XVII</i><br /> <br />THE TEST</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>On a morning some three months later,
the private flying field on the Bolton place
was the mecca of a considerable portion
of New Canaan’s population. The ridge
road and the surrounding meadows were
jammed with cars that flaunted license
plates of a dozen different states. Although
the December sun shone brightly in a cobalt
sky, the crowd shivered and stamped
on the frozen ground for the winter air
was icy. All eyes were turned upward toward
an airplane, high above their heads,
which swept the sky in immense, horizontal
circles.</p>

<p class='c008'>A small group of people bundled in
heavy fur coats stood and chatted by the
open doors of the hangar.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I almost wish they’d come down,” said
George Conway. “They must be half-dead
for want of sleep, and they’ve already
beaten the world’s record by hours. It
must be a terrific strain, especially for
Dorothy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh,” cried Betty Mayo. “Isn’t she marvelous?—and
Bill, too!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’re a pair of young idiots!”
growled old Mr. Lewis, whose false teeth
were chattering. “But I must admit they’re
first class sportsmen to stay up all this time
for a friend!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You said it.” declared Terry Walters,
and glanced at his wrist watch. “In exactly
one minute, they’ll have been up one
hundred and one hours, without refueling.
Gosh, it’s wonderful! That motor of your
father’s is some humdinger, Stoker!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, it’s simply adorable!” Betty was
brimming over with excitement. “And I
just can’t help being glad that that horrid
Mr. Joyce and his men are being sent to
Sing Sing for years and years and years!
It’s too—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here they come!” The crowd yelled
and roared and swarmed toward the roped-off
enclosure.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sure enough—At last the big plane was
spiralling downward. It landed lightly
on the frozen ground and bowled across
the field. The crowd surged in, but there
was no sign of life, no movement about the
plane. Mechanics jerked open the door,
and there, side by side, grimy, worn, unkempt,
were Dorothy Dixon and Bill Bolton,
sleeping like children!</p>

<p class='c008'>Somehow they were taken into the Bolton’s
house and put to bed, where they continued
to sleep for twelve hours, while certain
anxious gentlemen waited about, impatiently
demanding interviews.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pair eventually looked up from
quantities of ham and eggs in the dining
room, to greet their visitors.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, I want to talk business,” said the
portly man who led the van. “Mr. Conway
will not discuss the matter. He refers
me to you—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, you can talk to her,” said Bill. He
motioned to Dorothy. “She’s run this show
from start to finish.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And what,” asked the portly gentleman,
coming at once to the point, “will you
take for that motor, Miss Dixon?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hmmm—A hundred hours, without
refueling,” remarked Dorothy, thoughtfully
buttering a slice of toast. “I hope
you’ve given that some thought.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have given it several thoughts. Name
a price.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A million,” said Dorothy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dollars?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill kicked her under the table.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pounds, certainly,” said Dorothy. “I
went to England last year, and after I
learned how to figure their complicated
money, I’ve never been able to unlearn
it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She smiled benignly upon the company.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill nodded. “Dorothy’s some little bargainer,
ain’t she?” he said delightedly,
with his mouth full.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Give you a million dollars,” said the
portly gentleman.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Give up your place,” said Dorothy,
“and let some of these other gentlemen into
the game.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A million and a half,” said the portly
gentleman, edging closer to the table.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Make it two million and you win.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Done!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you,” smiled Dorothy. “Now
please make the check payable to George
Conway.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The gentlemen filed out of the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gee, you’re a whizbang, Dorothy!”
Bill exploded as soon as they were alone.
“Some Christmas present for Stoker!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re not so bad yourself,” laughed
the girl. “That kick of yours was worth
just a million dollars!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Five minutes later, the kitchen door of
the Bolton’s house was flung open and a
black face crowned with an aureole of
woolly hair peered in. “Has yo’all heard
de news, Liza?” panted Uncle Abe in
great excitement.</p>

<p class='c008'>“G’wan home, niggah, I’ze busy makin’
waffle fo’ de chilluns,” retorted the Bolton’s cook.
“Golly, but dey sure is hungry!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Dorothy done sol’ dat motah fo’
two million dollars. I wuz stickin’ roun’
outside an’ done hear de gen’men talkin’
’bout it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lan’s sakes, but dat a pile er money,”
said Liza pouring batter on to the hot
waffle iron. “How come Marse Bill was
able ter build dat engin’? I thought dat
de plans was lost?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You sho’ has a one-track mind, Liza,”
Uncle Abe observed contemptuously.
“And dat track spells nuthin’ but kitchen.
My young Missy <em>found</em> dem plans! She
beat all dose big detecatives to it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do tell! Whar was dey?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In er book, Liza.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shucks, I done heard ’bout de book.
Dey warn’t no plans inside it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Huh! Dey sho wuz, too!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whar dey at?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Dor’thy done took er knife an’
ripped dat book erpart! Dat little lady is
de quality, an’ she sure am smart. De
plans was on thin paper, pasted in de back
whar de leaves o’ de book am sewed togedder.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do tell!” Liza shook her head. “But
what I nevah did un’erstan’ wuz why
Marse Joyce tried ter kidnap de other boys
and girls.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Liza, you sho’ is dumb. It all come
out in de trial. Firs’ Marse Joyce think
Marse George know ’bout de plans, so his
men try ter make him tell. Den when Miss
Dor’thy busted up dat party, he know
dat de other chilluns would sho’ crab his
game if dey wuz let loose ter tell ’bout
it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Abe, you is crazy! How dat man goin’
ter keep all dose young folks locked in his
house while he try to sell dem plans? De
police sure find dem befo’ he’s able ter do
dat!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No. Liza, you’s wrong agin. Marse
Joyce knew a lot about dem plans. Marse
Conway had done tol’ him consider’ble
about dem, and Marse Joyce done tell de
Rooshians what Marse Conway tell him.
De Rooshians say dey give him a heap of
money jes’ as soon as he build dat engine.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“An’ Marse Joyce figured he’d beat it
to Rooshia jes’ as soon as he could put his
han’s on de plans?” said Liza.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dat’s right—” nodded the old darky.
“You ain’t quite ez dumb ez yo’ looks, niggah.
An’ de way Marse George is a-hangin’
roun’ Miss Betty—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yo’all talks too much,” Liza cut him
short. “Lan’ sakes! Gossipin’ at yo’ age!

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
